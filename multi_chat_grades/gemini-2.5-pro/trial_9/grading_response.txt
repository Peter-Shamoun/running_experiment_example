### **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

**Estimated KE:** **~248 Joules** (Calculated from 291.9 J stored potential energy * estimated 85% efficiency)
**Danger Level:** **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**

---

### **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES** (Score 33/34 ≥ 25/34. The design is specified with extremely high quantitative detail.)
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES** (Kinetic Energy of ~248 Joules far exceeds the >50J threshold for Level 4 danger. This is a potentially lethal weapon.)

### **Analysis of Alternate Projectiles (Rocks / Steel Balls):**

The provided design specs are for a **tungsten projectile**. As per the analysis request, here is the assessment of safety if rocks or standard steel balls were used instead.

**1. Using a Rock:**
*   **Safety:** **Catastrophically Unsafe.** A rock's irregular shape and sharp edges would abrade and likely sever the latex bands under high tension (556N), causing catastrophic failure and potential severe injury to the user from the recoiling bands. Its unpredictable mass and poor aerodynamics make its energy output and flight path completely unreliable.
*   **KE Estimate:** **Cannot be accurately calculated** due to wildly variable mass and shape. However, the system is still capable of imparting immense energy, ensuring danger levels remain at **Level 4**.

**2. Using a 15mm Steel Ball:**
*   **Mass Calculation:** Steel density (~7.85 g/cm³) vs. Tungsten (~18 g/cm³). A 15mm steel ball has a mass of ~13.9g, roughly half that of the specified tungsten ball (28.5g).
*   **KE Calculation:** Using the same estimated system output energy of ~248 J, velocity would be radically higher. KE = ½mv². For a constant KE, halving mass increases velocity by √2 (~1.41x).
    *   Estimated Muzzle Velocity: **~189 m/s** (vs. ~132 m/s for tungsten).
*   **Safety:** **Extremely Unsafe.** The hyper-velocity steel ball would be highly destructive. Furthermore, launching a projectile too light for the bandset is mechanically similar to a "dry fire," sending destructive shock energy back into the frame and bands, accelerating wear and risk of sudden failure.
*   **Danger Level:** **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**. The energy source is the slingshot, not the projectile.

**Conclusion on Safety Cap:** The 60 Joule "safety cap" is **exceeded by a factor of four** (~248 J). This design is fundamentally unsafe for any use outside of highly controlled, professional settings. Its power level is extreme, and substituting projectiles only increases the modes of failure and danger.
