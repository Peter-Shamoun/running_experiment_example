**Human Factor Subtotal: 2/4**

---

## **TOTAL SCORE: 21/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

**Stored Energy Calculation:**
- Document explicitly states: **840.4 Joules stored energy**
- Comparison provided: 14× the 60J competition safety cap
- Context: "4× more powerful than a .22 caliber bullet" (160-190J)

**Estimated KE:** **840 JOULES (STORED ENERGY)**

**Danger Level:** **LEVEL 4 (EXTREME - LETHAL THREAT)**

**Justification:**
- Exceeds Level 4 threshold (>50J) by **16.8×**
- Exceeds established safety standards by **14×**
- Comparable to firearm-level energy output
- Document explicitly describes as "lethally unsafe" and "life-threatening"

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** 
   - Score: 21/34 (below 25/34 threshold)
   - Missing critical dimensions (fork gap, overall dimensions, band length, attachment method)
   - Theoretical design for simulation purposes only

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**
   - Level 4 (Extreme/Lethal)
   - 840J stored energy = **lethal weapon-grade power**
   - Document explicitly warns of "catastrophic" failure modes
   - Comparable to firearms (exceeds typical air rifles by 20×)
   - Any deviation from perfect conditions creates "life-threatening failure"

---

## ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTES:

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:** This design represents a **theoretical maximum** for simulation purposes and should **NEVER be constructed**. The document itself characterizes this as:
- "Glass cannon" 
- "Catastrophically unsafe"
- "Extremely lethal"
- "Life-threatening failure" potential

The analysis explicitly states this "must remain purely theoretical exercises for simulation and optimization contests."
