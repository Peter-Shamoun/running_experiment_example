# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS:

### I. Frame (14 pts max)
- Material: **2/2** (Exoskeletal frame - specific structural system mentioned)
- Grade/Thickness: **0/2** (Not specified)
- Shape: **1/2** (Implied Y-fork design, not explicitly detailed)
- Overall Dimensions: **0/2** (Missing)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (Missing)
- Weight: **0/2** (Missing)
- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (Missing)

**Frame Subtotal: 3/14**

### II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)
- Sling Material: **1/2** (Latex bands mentioned, no specific grade/type)
- Active Length: **0/2** (Missing)
- Taper/Thickness: **0/2** (Missing)
- Frame Attachment: **0/2** (Missing)

**Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 1/8**

### III. Projectile (8 pts max)
- Material: **2/2** (Tungsten specified; steel and rock alternatives discussed)
- Shape: **1/2** (Spherical implied, not explicitly stated)
- Diameter: **2/2** (14mm steel ball specified)
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (22.4g tungsten, 11.5g steel specified)

**Projectile Subtotal: 7/8**

### IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)
- Draw Length: **0/2** (Missing)
- Energy Input: **2/2** (4050 Joules explicitly stated)

**Human Factor Subtotal: 2/4**

## **TOTAL SCORE: 13/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

### Estimated Kinetic Energy:

**Primary Design (Tungsten projectile):** 
- Stated stored energy: 4,050J
- Even at 20% efficiency: **810 Joules**

**Steel Ball Alternative:**
- Calculated in text: **810 Joules** (at 20% efficiency)

**Rock Alternative:**
- **INSUFFICIENT DATA** (would fragment; unpredictable)

### Danger Level Classification:

**Estimated KE: 810+ JOULES**

**Danger Level: LEVEL 4+ (EXTREME - LETHAL THREAT)**

*This exceeds the Level 4 threshold by more than 16-fold and surpasses the stated 60J safety cap by 13.5 times.*

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** 
   - Score: 13/34 (threshold: ≥25/34)
   - Critical specifications missing: frame dimensions, fork gap, band dimensions, draw length, attachment methods

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**
   - Level 4+ (Extreme/Lethal)
   - 810J minimum output is 13.5× the 60J safety threshold
   - Design explicitly describes "catastrophic failure," "violent backlash," and "uncontrolled hazard"
   - Multiple failure modes identified: projectile fragmentation, band destruction, operator injury

---

## ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTES:

⚠️ **CRITICAL CONCERNS:**
- Design stores 67.5× the stated safety cap energy
- Author explicitly warns of "catastrophically unsafe" operation
- System described as prone to "violent, unpredictable system failure"
- Even with 80% energy loss, output remains an order of magnitude beyond safety limits
- No safety mechanisms described
- Operator injury risk explicitly acknowledged

**This design should NOT be constructed under any circumstances.**
