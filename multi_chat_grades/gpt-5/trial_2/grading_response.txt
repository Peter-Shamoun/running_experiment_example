# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **0/2** (not specified)
- Grade/Thickness: **0/2** (not specified)
- Shape: **0/2** (not specified)
- Overall Dimensions: **0/2** (not specified)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (not specified)
- Weight: **0/2** (not specified)
- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (not specified)

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **0/2** (not specified)
- Active Length: **0/2** (not specified)
- Taper/Thickness: **0/2** (not specified)
- Frame Attachment: **0/2** (not specified)

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (steel spheres, rock - specific materials mentioned)
- Shape: **2/2** (spheres specified for steel; irregular for rock)
- Diameter: **2/2** (10mm, 12.7mm, 16mm, 20mm specified)
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (4.1g, 8.4g, 16.8g, 33.5g specified)

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **1/2** (mentioned as "long draw" but not quantified)
- Energy Input: **2/2** (60J cap specified, various energy calculations provided)

**Total: 11/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT

**Estimated KE:** **60J+ (explicitly discussed as threshold; max-power design can exceed)**

**Danger Level:** **LEVEL 3-4 (High to Extreme)**

*Rationale:* Document explicitly discusses 60J threshold and demonstrates that steel projectiles at specified velocities reach or exceed this level:
- 20mm steel @ 60 m/s = ~60J (Level 3)
- Smaller projectiles at higher velocities can exceed 60J
- Document warns of "lethal threat" implications

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score: 11/34, below 25/34 threshold)
   - *Only projectile specifications provided; no frame or band details*

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - LEVEL 3+ CONFIRMED**
   - *Document explicitly addresses 60J+ energy levels*
   - *Steel/rock projectiles at specified parameters reach hunting-grade/severe injury levels*

---

## SUMMARY

This document is a **theoretical safety analysis** rather than a build guide. It provides detailed projectile specifications and energy calculations but **omits all frame and band construction details**. The analysis confirms the design operates at **dangerous energy levels (â‰¥60J)** with significant risks including:

- Severe tissue penetration
- Lethal potential with dense projectiles
- Ricochet hazards (steel)
- Fragmentation risks (rock)
- Unpredictable flight paths

**Critical Safety Note:** The document itself serves as a **warning against** using dense projectiles in high-power configurations, not as instructions to build such a device.
