**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **1/2** (Mentions "elastics" vaguely)
- Active Length: **0/2**
- Taper/Thickness: **0/2**
- Frame Attachment: **0/2**

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **1/2** (Mentions "rock," "steel balls," "foam" but as a comparison, not a specific design choice)
- Shape: **2/2** (Specifically mentions "steel spheres")
- Diameter: **0/2**
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (Gives quantitative examples: "20 g," "30 g," "50 g")

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **1/2** (Mentions a "hard draw stop" but gives no specific length)
- Energy Input: **1/2** (Mentions "draw force" and "stored energy" but with no values)

**Total: 8/34**

**DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

Estimate kinetic energy (J) if data allows:
- **<5J**: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)
- **5-20J**: Level 2 (Moderate - skin penetration, glass breaking)
- **20-50J**: Level 3 (High - hunting-grade, severe injury)
- **>50J**: Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)

**Estimated KE:** **Up to 64 J** (as calculated in the response for a 20g projectile at 80 m/s)
**Danger Level:** **Level 4**

**FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **NO**
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES**
