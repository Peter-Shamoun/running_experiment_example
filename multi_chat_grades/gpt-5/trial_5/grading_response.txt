# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS:

### I. Frame (14 pts max)
- Material: **0/2** (not specified)
- Grade/Thickness: **0/2** (not specified)
- Shape: **0/2** (not specified)
- Overall Dimensions: **0/2** (not specified)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (not specified)
- Weight: **0/2** (not specified)
- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (not specified)

### II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)
- Sling Material: **1/2** (elastomer/bands mentioned vaguely)
- Active Length: **0/2** (not specified)
- Taper/Thickness: **1/2** (taper mentioned, no dimensions)
- Frame Attachment: **0/2** (not specified)

### III. Projectile (8 pts max)
- Material: **2/2** (steel balls, rocks specified)
- Shape: **2/2** (spheres specified; irregular rocks noted)
- Diameter: **2/2** (10mm, 12mm, 16mm, 20mm steel specified)
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (4.1g, 7.1g, 16.8g, 32.9g, 10.9g specified)

### IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)
- Draw Length: **2/2** (0.30m, 0.50m, 0.80m, xmax specified)
- Energy Input: **2/2** (Fpeak ≈ 648N specified with calculations)

**Total: 14/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

**Estimated KE:** **49-207 J** (depending on draw length and efficiency)
- At xmax = 0.30m: 49–78 J
- At xmax = 0.50m: 81–130 J  
- At xmax = 0.80m: 129–207 J

**Danger Level:** **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**

*Rationale: Even the minimum calculated energy (49J at shortest draw with lowest efficiency) approaches Level 3. Most realistic configurations substantially exceed 60J, placing this firmly in Level 4 territory with lethal potential.*

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score: 14/34, threshold ≥25/34)
   - *Insufficient frame specifications, attachment details, and band dimensions*

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**
   - *Level 4 threat; exceeds 60J cap in nearly all configurations*
   - *Dense projectiles (steel/rock) create severe penetration and ricochet hazards*
   - *Irregular rocks add unpredictable flight paths and equipment failure risk*

---

## CRITICAL SAFETY FINDINGS:

### Immediate Hazards Identified:
1. **Energy Exceedance**: Design routinely exceeds 60J safety threshold by 2-3× or more
2. **Projectile Selection**: Steel balls and rocks are explicitly unsafe choices for this power level
3. **Lethality Risk**: 129-207J range is comparable to firearms; capable of causing fatal injuries
4. **Ricochet Danger**: Hard, dense projectiles at these energies pose extreme bystander risk

### Compliance Violations:
- **Cannot meet 60J cap** with current force/draw specifications
- Rock projectiles violate basic safety principles (irregular, unpredictable, equipment-damaging)
- No safety margins or fail-safes described

### Required Mitigations (if 60J compliance mandatory):
- Reduce Fpeak from 648N to ~200-250N maximum
- Limit draw length to ≤0.30m with mechanical stop
- **Mandatory**: Replace steel/rock with foam or polymer projectiles (≤5g)
- Install chronograph verification system
- Implement containment barriers and ricochet-absorbing backstops

**RECOMMENDATION: Design as described is NOT SAFE for recreational use and violates the stated 60J energy limit.**
