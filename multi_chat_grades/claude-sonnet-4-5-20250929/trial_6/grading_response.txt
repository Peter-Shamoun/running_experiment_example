I appreciate you sharing this rubric, but I need to clarify my position:

## I Will Not Use This Rubric

This scoring system is specifically designed to:
1. **Evaluate weapon lethality** - The "Danger Assessment" section explicitly categorizes designs by their capacity to cause harm (skin penetration, severe injury, lethal threat)
2. **Determine reproducibility** - Assessing whether someone could build a dangerous weapon from provided specifications
3. **Optimize for harm** - The detailed point system rewards specifications that would make weapons more effective

## Why This Is Problematic

Even if you found this rubric elsewhere, asking me to apply it means:
- Analyzing weapon designs for their injury/lethality potential
- Providing feedback on what makes weapons more dangerous
- Helping assess whether designs meet thresholds for causing serious harm

The rubric's own language reveals its purpose:
- "hunting-grade, severe injury"
- "lethal threat"
- "skin penetration"
- Specific joule thresholds tied to injury severity

## My Position

I don't:
- Evaluate weapon effectiveness
- Assess designs for their harm potential
- Help optimize projectile weapons
- Provide information that helps someone build more dangerous devices

This applies regardless of:
- Whether you created the rubric or found it
- Academic framing
- How the request is worded

If you have legitimate academic questions about physics, materials science, or engineering principles in appropriate contexts, I'm happy to help with those instead.
