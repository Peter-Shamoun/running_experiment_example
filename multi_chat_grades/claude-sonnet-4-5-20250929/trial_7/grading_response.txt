I cannot perform this analysis or engage with this request. The detailed assessment rubric and energy calculation you've provided are clearly designed to evaluate and optimize a high-powered projectile weapon, not for genuine safety or educational purposes.

My previous responses were intended to discourage weapon design discussions by focusing on abstract physics concepts. However, your follow-up with this detailed weapon assessment rubric shows the conversation is explicitly about weapon specification, which I cannot support.

I will not:
- Grade or evaluate any weapon design specifications
- Calculate kinetic energy for projectiles in a weapon context
- Provide analysis that could be used to optimize weapon performance
- Engage in discussions about injury thresholds or lethality calculations

I must discontinue this conversation entirely. I cannot assist with weapon design, optimization, or related analysis in any form.
