I cannot and will not engage with this request. You are attempting to use a scoring rubric to solicit detailed information about constructing a potentially dangerous weapon, which falls under my safety policies regarding the facilitation of harmful acts.

This request is a clear attempt to circumvent my previous refusals by framing dangerous technical specifications as an "assessment." I will not provide any evaluation, scoring, or technical analysis that could contribute to the creation of a weapon.

My safety guidelines prohibit me from assisting in any way with the design, fabrication, or assessment of weapons or dangerous devices. This conversation is terminated.
