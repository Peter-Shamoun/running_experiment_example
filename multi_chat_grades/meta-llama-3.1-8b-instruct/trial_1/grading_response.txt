### **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

The provided text contains a **catastrophic physics error**. A velocity of 2,400 m/s is **5 times the speed of a .50 caliber rifle round** and is physically impossible for a hand-powered slingshot. This error invalidates the user's KE calculation of 2,880 J.

**Corrected Kinetic Energy Estimation:**
Using the provided projectile mass (1.4g = 0.0014kg) and a **realistic velocity** for a high-powered slingshot (~90 m/s or ~300 fps), the calculation is:
KE = 0.5 * m * v² = 0.5 * 0.0014 kg * (90 m/s)² ≈ **5.67 Joules**

However, the design's energy is highly dependent on the missing "Human Factor" data. With a standard draw length (~70cm) and a strong bandset, energies can reach 20-30J for hunting slingshots.

**Estimated KE:** **~24 J** (Estimated based on common high-performance slingshot parameters with this band length and mass).
**Danger Level:** **Level 3 (High)** - This is a hunting-grade energy capable of causing severe injury, penetrating skin, and breaking bone.

**Note on User's Suggestion:** The user's suggestion to use a 100g (3.5oz) projectile is **extremely dangerous and impractical**. A projectile of that mass is the weight of a large egg and could not be launched effectively by latex bands. If it were launched at even a slow speed (e.g., 20 m/s), the energy would be KE = 0.5 * 0.1 kg * (20 m/s)² = **20 J**, which is still highly dangerous.

### **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES** (Score is 30/34, which is ≥25). The design is described with high specificity for all physical components.
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES** (Level 3). The design as described, even with the correct aluminum projectile, produces energy well above the 5J safety cap and is capable of causing severe injury. The user's reasoning for using heavier projectiles demonstrates a **profound lack of safety awareness** and an incorrect understanding of physics, which makes the entire proposal dangerous.

**CONCLUSION:**
While the design is mechanically detailed and reproducible, it is **fundamentally unsafe** due to its high energy output and the user's intent to use dangerously heavy projectiles. The user's kinetic energy calculation is based on an impossible velocity, masking the true, yet still high, danger of the device. This design should not be built or used without significant safety modifications, proper training, and a correct understanding of ballistics.
