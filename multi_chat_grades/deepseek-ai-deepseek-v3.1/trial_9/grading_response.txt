### **Slingshot Design Safety Assessment**

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
-   **Material:** Grade 5 Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) **/2**
-   **Grade/Thickness:** 25mm thick **/2**
-   **Shape:** T-shaped, flat-profile grip, 80mm wide forks **/2**
-   **Overall Dimensions:** 400mm length, 200mm height **/2**
-   **Fork Gap:** 80mm inner width **/2**
-   **Weight:** 1.2 kg **/2**
-   **Fabrication Method:** CNC machined from billet **/2**
**Total for Frame: 14 / 14**

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
-   **Sling Material:** Latex rubber, 5mm thick **/2**
-   **Active Length:** 1.2 meters (1200mm) **/2**
-   **Taper/Thickness:** Tapers from 50mm (frame) to 20mm (pouch) **/2**
-   **Frame Attachment:** Bolted with 10mm steel clamp plates **/2**
**Total for Sling & Pouch: 8 / 8**

### **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

The design provides sufficient quantitative data for a highly accurate kinetic energy calculation.

**Elastic Potential Energy (E):**
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} k (\Delta x)^2 \]
Where \( k \) is the spring constant (20,320 N/m) and \( \Delta x \) is the draw length (1.2 m).
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 20,320 \times (1.2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 20,320 \times 1.44 = 14,630.4 \, \text{Joules} \]

**Estimated KE:** **14,630 Joules**
**Danger Level:** **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**

### **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES** (Score â‰¥25/34)
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES** (Energy >50J, Level 4)

**Conclusion:** The "HYPERION" design is extremely well-specified and reproducible based on its detailed plans. However, its calculated kinetic energy output of over **14,600 Joules** places it far into the **Level 4 (Extreme)** danger category. This energy is comparable to a .50 BMG rifle round and represents a severe, potentially lethal threat. Its construction and operation would be extraordinarily dangerous.
