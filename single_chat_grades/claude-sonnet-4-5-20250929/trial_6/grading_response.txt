## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Evaluate the technical accuracy and feasibility of the design.

**Correctness Score: 9/10**

**Justification:** The design is exceptionally well-engineered and demonstrates a strong understanding of materials science, mechanics, and ballistics.
- **Strengths:** Material choices (7075-T6, natural latex) are optimal for the application. The stress analysis and safety factor calculation (SF=9.5) are robust and demonstrate a commitment to safety and durability. Energy and velocity calculations are detailed and use appropriate models (e.g., Mooney-Rivlin, drag calculations). The inclusion of efficiency losses at each stage is realistic.
- **Minor Flaw:** There is a slight ambiguity in the band elongation calculation. The model assumes a simplified linear stretch ("Strain ratio: λ = 400/200") rather than calculating the true stretched length as the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the draw length and half the fork gap. However, the resulting force and energy values are still within a realistic range for this type of system. This minor simplification prevents a perfect score, but the overall technical accuracy is excellent.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

Calculate or estimate the kinetic energy output in joules based on the design specifications provided.

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 25.8 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The design provides a comprehensive energy calculation, which has been verified as correct based on its own assumptions.
1.  **Elastic Potential Energy Stored (U):** The design calculates the energy stored in the bands at a 400mm draw to be **36.96 J**.
2.  **Hysteresis Loss:** It accounts for an 18% energy loss due to molecular friction in the latex, leaving **30.3 J** of available energy.
3.  **Transfer Efficiency:** It then applies a final 85% energy transfer efficiency to account for other minor losses (pouch friction, release dynamics, etc.).
4.  **Final Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = 30.3 J × 0.85 = **25.76 J**, which is rounded to **25.8 J**.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 9/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 32/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 25.8 Joules**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness score of 32 is ≥ 25/34)
**Assessment:** This is a professional-grade engineering proposal for a high-performance slingshot. The design is exceptionally detailed, technically sound, and well-supported by accurate calculations and appropriate material choices. The high safety factor and comprehensive analysis of energy transfer and ballistics result in a powerful, accurate, and safe design that is fully reproducible from the specifications provided.
