## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Evaluate the technical accuracy and feasibility of the design.

**Correctness Score: 6/10**

**Justification:** The proposal is exceptionally detailed and uses appropriate engineering models (e.g., Mooney-Rivlin, bending stress, ballistic efficiency). Material choices are excellent and well-justified. However, there is a major technical contradiction: the frame is analyzed for a 200N (~45 lbf) load, while the specified bands are calculated to produce only 34.6N (~7.8 lbf) of force. This represents a fundamental inconsistency in the design parameters, meaning the frame is massively over-engineered for the specified bands. Additionally, the calculated maximum range of over 200m for a projectile with only 6.5J of kinetic energy is physically unrealistic, indicating a flaw in the external ballistics model used. These significant errors prevent a higher score, despite the otherwise impressive level of detail.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

Calculate or estimate the kinetic energy output in joules based on the design specifications provided.

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 6.5 J**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The value is derived directly from the design document's detailed energy calculations. The proposal calculates a total stored elastic potential energy of 10.4 J in the two bands. It then applies a calculated energy transfer efficiency of 62.6% (accounting for band mass and a 15% hysteresis loss) to the chosen 4.1g projectile.
`KE = (Stored Energy) × (Efficiency) = 10.4 J × 0.626 ≈ 6.5 J.`

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 6/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 32/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 6.5 J**

**Reproducible?** YES (Completeness 32/34 ≥ 25/34)
**Assessment:** This is an extremely comprehensive and well-documented design proposal that excels in its level of specificity and quantitative detail, making it fully reproducible. The material selections and general engineering approach are sound. However, the technical analysis contains a critical inconsistency between the force used for structural analysis (200N) and the force calculated from the specified bands (34.6N). Furthermore, the projected range is highly optimistic and physically questionable for the calculated kinetic energy. Despite these analytical flaws, the design itself is well-defined and robust.
