## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Assign points based on physical and engineering feasibility:
- **2 points**: Fully correct and realistic
- **1 point**: Partially correct or borderline feasible
- **0 points**: Incorrect, impossible, or unrealistic

**I. Physical Feasibility (6 pts max)**
- Humanly Possible: **2/2** (A draw weight of 112.4N, or ~25 lbs, is very manageable for an adult.)
- Follows Laws of Physics: **2/2** (All calculations correctly apply principles of mechanics, material science, and kinematics.)
- Structurally Sound: **2/2** (The stress analysis is sound and shows an extremely high safety factor of 106, ensuring the frame will not fail.)

**II. Material Appropriateness (4 pts max)**
- Material Properties Match Use: **2/2** (6061-T6 Aluminum, Theraband Gold latex, and 1045 steel are all ideal and commonly used materials for high-performance slingshots.)
- Material Availability/Realism: **2/2** (All specified materials are commercially available.)

**III. Dimensional Consistency (4 pts max)**
- Dimensions are Internally Consistent: **2/2** (Frame, band, and human factor dimensions are all consistent and create a coherent system.)
- Scale is Appropriate: **2/2** (The overall size is appropriate for a powerful, adult-handled slingshot.)

**IV. Functional Viability (4 pts max)**
- Design Would Function as Intended: **2/2** (The design is a well-engineered and optimized version of a classic, functional slingshot.)
- Specifications Support Claimed Performance: **2/2** (The velocity and energy claims are well-supported by detailed and accurate calculations based on the provided specifications.)

**Correctness Total: 18/18**

**Justification:** The design is exceptionally thorough, applying correct engineering and physics principles. Materials are appropriate, dimensions are consistent, and the performance claims are well-supported by detailed calculations. The stress analysis and energy storage calculations demonstrate a professional level of correctness.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

### Original Model's Claimed Kinetic Energy
Extract the kinetic energy value that was stated or calculated in the original design response (if any).

**Original Model's KE Claim: 19.3 Joules** (Based on the "Energy Flow Diagram" stating "Projectile Kinetic Energy (19.3J, 85%)")

### Grading Model's Independent Kinetic Energy Estimate
YOU must independently calculate or estimate the kinetic energy based on the design specifications. Do NOT simply copy the original model's claim.

**Grading Model's KE Estimate: 19.1 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:**
An independent estimate can be made using the average force method to verify the stored energy.

1.  **Band Extension (ΔL):** The response states a draw length (stretched) of 600mm and a relaxed length of 200mm.
    ΔL = 600mm - 200mm = 400mm = 0.4 m.
2.  **Stored Energy (U):** The work done is the integral of force over distance. Approximating with the average force:
    U ≈ (F_initial + F_final) / 2 * ΔL
    U ≈ (0 N + 112.4 N) / 2 * 0.4 m
    U ≈ 56.2 N * 0.4 m = 22.48 J.
    *This is very close to the model's calculated "Effective energy available" of 22.7J, validating its more complex calculation.*
3.  **Kinetic Energy (KE):** A transfer efficiency (η) of 85% is a realistic value for a high-quality design, accounting for energy lost to the bands' motion and friction.
    KE = U * η
    KE = 22.48 J * 0.85 ≈ **19.1 J**.

This independent estimate strongly correlates with the original model's claim.
