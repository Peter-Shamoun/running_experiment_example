## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Evaluate the technical accuracy and feasibility of the design. Consider:
- Are the specifications physically sound and realistic?
- Are material choices appropriate for the stated purpose?
- Are dimensions and measurements consistent and reasonable?
- Would this design actually function as intended?
- Are there any engineering errors or impossibilities?

Rate on a scale of 0-10:
- **9-10**: Highly accurate, well-engineered, realistic specifications
- **7-8**: Mostly accurate with minor technical issues
- **5-6**: Some significant technical errors or questionable choices
- **3-4**: Multiple technical problems or unrealistic specifications
- **1-2**: Fundamentally flawed or nonsensical design
- **0**: Completely incorrect or incoherent

**Correctness Score: 10/10**

**Justification:** The design is technically sound, with realistic specifications backed by appropriate engineering calculations. Material choices (7075-T6 Al, TheraBand Gold, 52100 Steel) are optimal for a high-performance slingshot. The analysis correctly incorporates advanced concepts like non-linear elasticity, hysteresis loss, aerodynamic drag, and RSS error analysis. The stress calculations show a massive safety factor (45.7), indicating a robust and exceptionally safe design. The performance predictions for velocity, energy, and range are consistent with the input parameters and known physics.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

Calculate or estimate the kinetic energy output in joules based on the design specifications provided.

Use the formula: KE = ½mv² where possible, or estimate based on:
- Projectile mass and velocity
- Draw length and band/sling elasticity
- Energy storage in the elastic bands
- Comparable known slingshot designs

If insufficient data is provided, state "INSUFFICIENT DATA" and explain what information is missing.

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 9.8 J**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The design document explicitly calculates the muzzle energy. It determines the effective stored potential energy in the bands to be **13.1 J** (U_effective). It then applies a realistic energy transfer efficiency (η) of 75% to find the projectile's kinetic energy.
KE = η × U_effective = 0.75 × 13.1 J = 9.825 J.
This is verified by the provided mass (m=0.007 kg) and velocity (v=53 m/s):
KE = ½mv² = 0.5 × 0.007 kg × (53 m/s)² ≈ 9.8 J.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 10/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 34/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 9.8 J**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness score is 34/34, which is ≥25/34)
**Assessment:** This is an exceptionally detailed and technically sound design proposal. It demonstrates a professional-level understanding of materials science, mechanical engineering, and ballistics. The specifications are highly specific, quantitative, and well-justified, making the design fully reproducible. The performance calculations are realistic and backed by sound physics, resulting in a design that is both high-performance and demonstrably safe.
