## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**Correctness Score: 5/10**

**Justification:** The design demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of materials science, stress analysis, and ballistic principles. The choice of 7075-T6 aluminum, tapered latex bands, and precision projectiles is excellent. However, the core performance analysis is fundamentally flawed due to a major inconsistency in the energy storage calculation (Section 2.3). The stated 600mm draw length contradicts the calculation which uses an effective draw of ~300mm and a very low strain (80%). If the 600mm draw were used with the specified 200mm bands, the calculated draw force would be superhuman (>290 lbf / 1300 N). This critical error invalidates the subsequent calculations for stored energy (31 J), projectile velocity (62.9 m/s), and kinetic energy (14 J), which are all unrealistically low for a competition design of this caliber. This represents a significant engineering error in an otherwise impressive document.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 14.0 J**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The value is taken directly from the "Performance Analysis" section of the provided design document. The design calculates a total stored elastic potential energy of 31.0 J and, after accounting for various energy losses (hysteresis, band/pouch kinetic energy), arrives at a projectile kinetic energy of 14.0 J.

**NOTE:** This calculation is based on the significant inconsistency detailed in the Correctness Score justification. The energy value reflects the flawed calculation based on ~300mm draw, not the stated 600mm draw length specification. The design as specified is not feasible for a human operator.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 5/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 34/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 14.0 J**

**Reproducible?** YES
**Assessment:** The design is exceptionally comprehensive and detailed, achieving a perfect score for completeness. It covers all aspects from material science to manufacturing with a high degree of specificity. However, it contains a critical and fundamental error in its core energy and performance calculations. The contradiction between the stated draw length and the strain used for calculations makes the performance claims (velocity, energy) invalid as presented. While the frame and component design are sound, the elastic system is not functionally viable as described.
