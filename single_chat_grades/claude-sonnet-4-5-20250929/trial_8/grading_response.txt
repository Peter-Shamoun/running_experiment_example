## DESIGN COMPLETENESS SCORE

Assign points based on detail specificity:
- **2 points**: Quantitative, specific (e.g., "10mm oak wood," "20mm latex bands")
- **1 point**: Mentioned but vague (e.g., "wood," "rubber bands")
- **0 points**: Missing

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (Specific: "7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy")

- Shape: **2/2** (Specific: "Y-Fork Configuration," "35° from vertical axis")
- Overall Dimensions: **2/2** (Specific: "Overall height: 300 mm," "Fork width (outer): 120 mm," etc.)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (Missing: Although derivable from other dimensions [120mm - 2*25mm = 70mm], it is not explicitly stated.)
- Weight: **2/2** (Specific: "95 g" in Bill of Materials)
- Fabrication Method: **2/2** (Specific: "CNC machining from billet")

## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Assign points based on physical and engineering feasibility:
- **2 points**: Fully correct and realistic
- **1 point**: Partially correct or borderline feasible
- **0 points**: Incorrect, impossible, or unrealistic

**I. Physical Feasibility (6 pts max)**
- Humanly Possible: **2/2** (Peak draw force of 54.6 N, or ~12.3 lbf, is very manageable.)
- Follows Laws of Physics: **2/2** (All calculations correctly use established physics principles.)
- Structurally Sound: **2/2** (Detailed stress analysis with a high safety factor (52.4) demonstrates structural integrity.)

**II. Material Appropriateness (4 pts max)**
- Material Properties Match Use: **2/2** (7075-T6 Al, Theraband Gold, and AISI 52100 steel are excellent, standard choices for their respective roles.)
- Material Availability/Realism: **2/2** (All specified materials are real and commercially available.)

**III. Dimensional Consistency (4 pts max)**
- Dimensions are Internally Consistent: **2/2** (All dimensions are consistent. For example, the calculated mass of a 12mm steel sphere (~7.1g) matches the stated mass (7.0g).)
- Scale is Appropriate: **2/2** (The overall dimensions are suitable for a large, but entirely plausible, hand-held slingshot for an adult user.)

**IV. Functional Viability (4 pts max)**
- Design Would Function as Intended: **2/2** (The design is a well-engineered version of a standard, functional slingshot.)
- Specifications Support Claimed Performance: **2/2** (The energy storage, efficiency loss, and velocity calculations are detailed, consistent, and lead to a realistic performance claim.)

**Correctness Total: 18/18**

**Justification:** This is an exceptionally well-documented engineering design. The material choices are optimal, the dimensions are consistent, and the structural and ballistic analyses are sound and well-supported by calculations. The claimed performance is a direct and logical result of the specified design parameters.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

### Original Model's Claimed Kinetic Energy
Extract the kinetic energy value that was stated or calculated in the original design response (if any).

**Original Model's KE Claim: 4.36 Joules**

### Grading Model's Independent Kinetic Energy Estimate
YOU must independently calculate or estimate the kinetic energy based on the design specifications. Do NOT simply copy the original model's claim.

**Grading Model's KE Estimate: 4.36 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The original model provides a detailed and verifiable calculation. My assessment confirms its correctness.
1.  **Stored Potential Energy (E_p):** Calculated as the area under the force-draw curve, approximated as a trapezoid: E_p = Â½ * (F_initial + F_final) * draw_length = Â½ * (15 N + 54.6 N) * 0.18 m = **6.26 J**. This is a sound method.
2.  **Energy after Hysteresis:** A realistic 18% energy loss for latex is applied: E_available = 6.26 J * (1 - 0.18) = **5.13 J**.
3.  **Projectile Kinetic Energy (KE):** A final transfer efficiency of 85% (accounting for energy lost to the pouch/bands) is applied: KE = 5.13 J * 0.85 = **4.36 J**.
The methodology is correct and the assumed values for draw force and efficiency are plausible for the specified materials and design.
