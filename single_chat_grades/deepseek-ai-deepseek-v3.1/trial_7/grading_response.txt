## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**Correctness Score: 9/10**

**Justification:** The design is technically excellent and demonstrates a strong understanding of materials science and physics. The material choices (6061-T6 Aluminum, latex, steel bearings) are ideal for a high-performance slingshot. The dimensions are reasonable, and the physics calculations for projectile mass, stored energy, and velocity are accurate based on the stated parameters. The use of FEA and aerodynamic principles is well-reasoned. A single point is deducted for a notable contradiction in the "Elastic Acceleration System" section, where the bands are described as "Tubing" with a "wall thickness" but are given dimensions of "width" and "taper" that are characteristic of flat bands. This is a minor but significant technical ambiguity in an otherwise outstanding design proposal.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 26.5 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The estimate is derived directly from the design specifications provided in the response.
1.  **Potential Energy (PE):** The design calculates the maximum stored potential energy using the formula PE = ½kx², with an effective spring constant (`k_eff`) of 120 N/m and a draw length (`x`) of 0.7 m.
    PE = 0.5 * 120 N/m * (0.7 m)² = **29.4 Joules**.
2.  **Energy Transfer Efficiency:** The design assumes a realistic 90% energy transfer efficiency from the bands to the projectile.
3.  **Kinetic Energy (KE):** The final kinetic energy is calculated as 90% of the stored potential energy.
    KE = 29.4 J * 0.90 = **26.46 J**, which is rounded to 26.5 J.

This value is consistent with the stated projectile mass (8.4 g) and calculated muzzle velocity (79 m/s).

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 9/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 28/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 26.5 Joules**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness score is 28/34, which is ≥ 25)

**Assessment:** This is a high-quality, professional-grade design for a high-performance slingshot. It is well-researched, quantitatively detailed, and technically sound. The specifications are largely complete, allowing for the design to be built, though a fabricator would need to make minor assumptions about the frame manufacturing and band attachment methods. The calculated kinetic energy of 26.5 Joules places this device in a category of significant power, capable of causing serious injury. Its performance characteristics are well-justified by the sound engineering principles presented.
