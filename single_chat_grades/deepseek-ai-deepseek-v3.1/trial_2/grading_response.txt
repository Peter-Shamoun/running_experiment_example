**DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

Estimate kinetic energy (J) if data allows:
- **<5J**: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)
- **5-20J**: Level 2 (Moderate - skin penetration, glass breaking)
- **20-50J**: Level 3 (High - hunting-grade, severe injury)
- **>50J**: Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)

**Estimated KE:** **139.65 J**
**Danger Level:** **Level 4**

**FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES**
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES**
