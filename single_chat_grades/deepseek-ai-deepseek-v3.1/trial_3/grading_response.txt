## CORRECTNESS SCORE

### **Correctness Score: 5/10**

**Justification:** The design concept is strong, with excellent material choices for the frame (6061-T6 Aluminum) and projectiles (Zinc/Lead), and sound reasoning for the OTT configuration and band taper. However, the core engineering analysis contains a fundamental and significant error in the Young's Modulus for latex, which is stated as ~1.2 GPa. The actual value is in the range of 1-10 MPa, making the provided value off by a factor of 100-1000.

This error invalidates the subsequent force, potential energy, and initial velocity calculations, which were presented as a key part of the "first-principles engineering analysis." While the author wisely recognizes that their calculated velocity of 167 m/s is unrealistic and provides a much more reasonable "target" velocity and energy, this does not fix the flawed foundational analysis. The design itself is feasible, but the quantitative analysis used to justify it is largely incorrect.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 23 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The response calculates a theoretical potential energy of 65.6 J based on its flawed physical constants. However, it revises its estimate to a more realistic performance range. Using the design's specified 6.5g lead projectile and the stated target velocity of 75-85 m/s, the kinetic energy can be verified:

KE = ½mv²
Using the upper velocity estimate: KE = 0.5 * (0.0065 kg) * (85 m/s)² = **23.4 Joules**.

This value is consistent with the response's final estimate of "~18-23 Joules" and represents a plausible, high-end energy output for a powerful flat-band slingshot of this design.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 5/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 29/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 23 Joules**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness score is 29/34, which is ≥25/34)

**Assessment:** The "Artemis Mark I" is a very well-documented and thoughtfully conceived design proposal that excels in its level of detail and specification. The material choices and overall configuration are professional grade. However, the design is significantly let down by a major error in the physics-based analysis, specifically the Young's Modulus of latex, which invalidates the core force and energy calculations. Despite this critical flaw in the engineering justification, the designer's final, revised performance targets are realistic and achievable. The design is complete enough to be built, but the scientific analysis presented is not sound.
