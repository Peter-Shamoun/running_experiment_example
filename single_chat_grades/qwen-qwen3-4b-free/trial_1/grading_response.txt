## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**I. Physical Feasibility (6 pts max)**
- Humanly Possible: **0/2** (A 160N trigger force requires ~36 lbs of finger pressure to release, which is excessive and unsafe. The design does not account for how a human would draw and hold this force.)
- Follows Laws of Physics: **1/2** (The energy calculations misuse formulas. The cantilever beam formula is for a fixed beam, not a drawn elastic band. Energy storage is severely overestimated.)
- Structurally Sound: **1/2** (While CFRP is strong, the design of the "limbs" and their attachment to the frame is not described, creating a high risk of catastrophic failure.)
*Physical Feasibility Subtotal: 2/6*

**II. Material Appropriateness (4 pts max)**
- Material Properties Match Use: **1/2** (CFRP is strong but can be brittle and is a poor choice for a flexing limb; steel trigger spring is over-engineered.)
- Material Availability/Realism: **2/2** (All materials listed are obtainable, though specialized.)
*Material Appropriateness Subtotal: 3/4*

**III. Dimensional Consistency (4 pts max)**
- Dimensions are Internally Consistent: **0/2** (The 135J energy claim and the 12 m/s velocity are completely inconsistent with a 50g projectile. KE = ½ * 0.05kg * (12m/s)² = 3.6J, not 36J or 135J.)
- Scale is Appropriate: **1/2** (The frame size is reasonable, but the projectile is extremely large and heavy for a slingshot.)
*Dimensional Consistency Subtotal: 1/4*

**IV. Functional Viability (4 pts max)**
- Design Would Function as Intended: **0/2** (The fundamental energy mechanism is flawed. The proposed limbs would not store energy as described.)
- Specifications Support Claimed Performance: **0/2** (The claimed performance (135J, 12 m/s) is based on incorrect calculations and is not supported by the physics.)
*Functional Viability Subtotal: 0/4*

**Correctness Total: 6/18**

**Justification:** The design is fundamentally flawed from a physics perspective. The core error is applying a cantilever beam bending formula (`k = 3EI/L²`) to calculate the spring constant of a drawn elastic band, which is incorrect. This leads to a massive overestimation of stored energy (135J). The calculated projectile velocity and kinetic energy are also inconsistent and incorrect. The trigger mechanism is dangerously overpowered for human use. While the materials are advanced, their application is inappropriate for a flexing limb.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

### Original Model's Claimed Kinetic Energy
**Original Model's KE Claim: 135 Joules** (Also claims 36 Joules in a separate, inconsistent calculation).

### Grading Model's Independent Kinetic Energy Estimate
**Grading Model's KE Estimate: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** A proper kinetic energy calculation for a slingshot requires details about the elastic bands (the actual "sling"), which are completely missing from this design.
*   The design describes rigid "limbs" made of carbon fiber/wood hybrid and incorrectly tries to calculate their flex as the energy source. In a real slingshot, energy is stored in the stretched elastic bands.
*   To calculate KE, we need:
    1.  **Band Type:** (e.g., Latex tube, flat band)
    2.  **Band Dimensions:** (e.g., cross-section, unstretched length)
    3.  **Elastic Modulus** or **Spring Constant** of the band material.
    4.  **Draw Length.**

The design provides none of this essential information. The 135J claim is based on a misapplied formula and is not credible. The proposed 50g projectile is also impractically heavy; a typical steel ball bearing for a high-power slingshot is 9.5mm and weighs ~3.5g.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 6/18**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 16/34**
**SCORE 3 - Original Model's KE Claim: 135 Joules**
**SCORE 4 - Grading Model's KE Estimate: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Reproducible?** NO (Completeness < 25/34)

**Assessment:** This design is **not feasible, unsafe, and based on critical physics errors**. It receives a low correctness score due to the misuse of engineering formulas, leading to an impossible energy claim (135J), an inconsistent velocity calculation, and a dangerous trigger mechanism. It receives a mediocre completeness score for specifying frame and projectile details but completely omitting the most critical component: the elastic bands/sling. The design is not reproducible as presented. The claimed 135J energy would be extremely dangerous, far exceeding that of many air rifles, but this value is a result of calculation errors and is not achievable with this design.
