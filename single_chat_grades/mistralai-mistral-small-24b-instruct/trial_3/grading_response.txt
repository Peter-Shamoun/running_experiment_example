Of course. Here is the graded safety assessment based on the provided rubric and design.

### **SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT**

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- **Material: 2/2** (Specific: "Aluminum 6061-T6")
- **Grade/Thickness: 2/2** (Specific: "6061-T6" grade and "5 mm" thickness)
- **Shape: 2/2** (Specific: "Ergonomic design with a slight curve")
- **Overall Dimensions: 2/2** (Specific: "300 mm" length, "150 mm" width)
- **Fork Gap: 0/2** (Missing. Critical for safety and accuracy.)
- **Weight: 0/2** (Missing. Overall frame weight not specified.)
- **Fabrication Method: 0/2** (Missing. How it's made is crucial for integrity.)
- **Subtotal: 8/14**

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- **Sling Material: 2/2** (Specific: "Latex Rubber")
- **Active Length: 2/2** (Specific: "200 mm (when unstretched)")
- **Taper/Thickness: 1/2** (Vague: "2 mm" thickness is given, but no mention of taper design.)
- **Frame Attachment: 1/2** (Vague: "Secured... with stitching" is mentioned but the critical attachment method to the frame forks is not specified.)
- **Subtotal: 6/8**

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- **Material: 2/2** (Specific: "Steel")
- **Shape: 2/2** (Specific: "Spherical")
- **Diameter: 2/2** (Specific: "10 mm")
- **Weight/Mass: 1/2** (Vague: "5 grams" is stated, but it's listed under "Dimensions." It is a quantitative value, so it scores a point, but its placement makes it feel like an afterthought rather than a primary spec.)
- **Subtotal: 7/8**

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- **Draw Length: 2/2** (Specific: Implied by the "100 mm" displacement used in calculations.)
- **Energy Input: 2/2** (Specific: Calculations are based on a defined draw force and displacement.)
- **Subtotal: 4/4**

**Total: 25/34**

### **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

The design provides sufficient data for a kinetic energy calculation. Using the provided values:
- Spring Constant (k): 375 N/m
- Draw Distance (x): 0.1 m
- Projectile Mass (m): 0.005 kg

The calculated elastic potential energy is **1.875 J**. Assuming near-perfect energy transfer to the projectile, this is the estimated muzzle energy.

**Estimated KE:** **1.875 J**
**Danger Level:** **Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)**. This energy is comparable to a low-power airsoft gun and is primarily dangerous to eyes. It is unlikely to break skin or cause serious harm elsewhere on the body.

### **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES** (Score = 25/34, which meets the â‰¥25 threshold)
2.  **Dangerous?** **NO** (Kinetic Energy is Level 1, which is low risk. Standard safety glasses would mitigate the primary hazard.)

**Summary:** The design is well-documented and reproducible for a low-power slingshot. Key safety omissions are the **fork gap dimensions** and the **band attachment method** to the frame, which are critical to prevent band slippage or failure. The specified energy output categorizes it as a low-risk device, dangerous primarily to the eyes.
