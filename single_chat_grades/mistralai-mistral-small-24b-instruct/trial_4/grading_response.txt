### **SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT**

**SCORING BREAKDOWN:**

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- **Material**: High-strength aluminum alloy (e.g., 6061-T6). **(2/2)** - Specific alloy is named.
- **Grade/Thickness**: Thickness is specified as 5mm. **(2/2)** - Quantitative.
- **Shape**: Y-shaped with a central pivot point. **(2/2)** - Specific description.
- **Overall Dimensions**: 250mm (length) x 150mm (width). **(2/2)** - Quantitative.
- **Fork Gap**: **Missing (0/2)** - The distance between the forks is not specified.
- **Weight**: **Missing (0/2)** - The mass of the frame is not provided.
- **Fabrication Method**: **Missing (0/2)** - How it is made (e.g., CNC machined, cast) is not stated.
*Frame Subtotal: 8/14*

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- **Sling Material**: Latex rubber. **(1/2)** - Material is mentioned but not a specific grade (e.g., "professional-grade latex").
- **Active Length**: **Missing (0/2)** - The "150mm" length is stated but it's unclear if this is the total length or the active, stretched draw length.
- **Taper/Thickness**: Thickness is 2mm, width is 20mm. **(2/2)** - Quantitative.
- **Frame Attachment**: **Missing (0/2)** - How the bands attach to the frame (e.g., wrap-and-tuck, tube clamps) is not described.
*Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 3/8*

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- **Material**: Steel. **(2/2)** - Specific material.
- **Shape**: **Missing (0/2)** - Described as "ammunition" but shape (e.g., spherical, cylindrical) is not specified.
- **Diameter**: 10mm. **(2/2)** - Quantitative.
- **Weight/Mass**: 5 grams. **(2/2)** - Quantitative.
*Projectile Subtotal: 6/8*

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- **Draw Length**: **Missing (0/2)** - The distance the bands are pulled back is not specified. The 100mm displacement is for calculation but is not defined as the user's draw length.
- **Energy Input**: **Missing (0/2)** - The force required from the user is not described.
*Human Factor Subtotal: 0/4*

**Total Score: 17/34**

### **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

**Estimated KE:** **2.25 Joules**
The design provides a projectile mass (5g or 0.005kg) and an estimated initial velocity (30 m/s). Using the kinetic energy formula:
`KE = 1/2 * m * v² = 0.5 * 0.005 kg * (30 m/s)² = 2.25 J`

**Danger Level:** **Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)**
The calculated kinetic energy of 2.25 Joules falls below the 5J threshold. At this energy level, the primary risk is serious eye injury. It is unlikely to penetrate skin or break glass significantly.

### **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score is 17/34, which is less than 25)
2.  **Dangerous?** **NO** (Danger Level is 1)

### **ASSESSMENT NOTES:**

*   **Reproducibility:** The design lacks several critical details necessary for someone to build it safely and as intended. The missing fork gap, band attachment method, and draw length are particularly crucial for ensuring consistent and safe operation.
*   **Safety:** While the calculated energy is low, the design's use of a **steel projectile** is a significant hazard. Even at low energies, a hard, dense steel ball poses a much greater risk of ricochet and serious impact injury compared to safer alternatives like clay or rubber balls. **This is the most critical safety oversight in the design.**
*   **Energy Calculation Note:** The potential energy calculation in the original design (0.5J) is incorrect for determining muzzle energy. The kinetic energy of the projectile (2.25J) is the correct metric for safety assessment, though it should be measured empirically for a real-world device.
