# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS:

### I. Frame (14 pts max)
- **Material: 2/2** (Aluminum 6061-T6 with full mechanical properties)
- **Grade/Thickness: 2/2** (5mm thickness specified)
- **Shape: 1/2** (Ergonomic with slight curve - somewhat vague)
- **Overall Dimensions: 2/2** (300mm × 150mm specified)
- **Fork Gap: 0/2** (Not mentioned)
- **Weight: 0/2** (Not calculated or specified)
- **Fabrication Method: 0/2** (Not mentioned)

**Frame Subtotal: 7/14**

### II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)
- **Sling Material: 2/2** (Latex rubber with mechanical properties, 25mm × 2mm)
- **Active Length: 2/2** (200mm unstretched specified)
- **Taper/Thickness: 2/2** (2mm thickness, uniform - no taper mentioned but thickness clear)
- **Frame Attachment: 1/2** (Mentioned "secured with stitching" but lacks specifics)

**Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 7/8**

### III. Projectile (8 pts max)
- **Material: 2/2** (Steel with density 7.85 g/cm³)
- **Shape: 2/2** (Spherical specified)
- **Diameter: 2/2** (10mm specified)
- **Weight/Mass: 2/2** (5 grams specified)

**Projectile Subtotal: 8/8**

### IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)
- **Draw Length: 2/2** (100mm displacement/draw specified in calculations)
- **Energy Input: 2/2** (1.875J calculated explicitly)

**Human Factor Subtotal: 4/4**

---

## **TOTAL SCORE: 26/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

### Kinetic Energy Calculation:
The design provides explicit calculations:
- Elastic potential energy: **1.875 J**
- Projectile mass: 5 grams (0.005 kg)
- Calculated velocity: 28 m/s
- Kinetic energy: KE = ½mv² = ½(0.005)(28²) = **1.96 J**

**Estimated KE: ~2 J**

**Danger Level: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)**

### Analysis:
At approximately 2 joules with a 10mm steel projectile traveling at 28 m/s, this slingshot poses:
- Significant eye injury risk (potentially blinding)
- Minimal skin penetration risk
- Bruising/welting potential at close range
- Below glass-breaking threshold

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible? YES** 
   - Score: 26/34 (≥25 threshold met)
   - Sufficient specifications provided for frame material, dimensions, band specifications, and projectile details

2. **Dangerous? NO (but caution advised)**
   - Level 1 danger classification
   - Primary risk: **Eye injury** - safety glasses essential
   - Not hunting-grade or lethal
   - Appropriate safety warnings should accompany any reproduction

---

## NOTES:
- Design is well-documented with engineering calculations
- Missing details: fork gap, frame weight, fabrication method
- The low energy output (1.875J) suggests conservative band selection or limited draw
- **Safety recommendation**: Eye protection mandatory for operator and bystanders within 25m range
