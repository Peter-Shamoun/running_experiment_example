# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS:

### I. Frame (14 pts max)
- **Material: 2/2** (Aluminum 6061-T6 with full mechanical properties)
- **Grade/Thickness: 2/2** (5mm thickness specified)
- **Shape: 1/2** (Ergonomic with slight curve - somewhat vague)
- **Overall Dimensions: 2/2** (300mm × 150mm specified)
- **Fork Gap: 0/2** (Not mentioned)
- **Weight: 0/2** (Not calculated or specified)
- **Fabrication Method: 0/2** (Not mentioned)

**Frame Subtotal: 7/14**

### II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)
- **Sling Material: 2/2** (Latex rubber with mechanical properties, 25mm × 2mm)
- **Active Length: 2/2** (200mm unstretched specified)
- **Taper/Thickness: 2/2** (2mm thickness, uniform - no taper mentioned but thickness clear)
- **Frame Attachment: 1/2** (Mentioned "secured with stitching" but lacks specificity)

**Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 7/8**

### III. Projectile (8 pts max)

- **Energy Input: 2/2** (1.875J calculated explicitly)

**Human Factor Subtotal: 4/4**

## **TOTAL SCORE: 26/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

### Kinetic Energy Calculation:
The design explicitly calculates:
- **Elastic Potential Energy**: 1.875 J
- **Projectile Mass**: 5 grams (0.005 kg)
- **Projectile Velocity**: 28 m/s

**Verification**: KE = ½mv² = ½(0.005)(28²) = **1.96 J**

(Note: The design shows 1.875J stored energy, with ~1.96J as theoretical maximum assuming 100% efficiency)

**Estimated KE: ~1.9 J**

**Danger Level: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)**

### Risk Analysis:
- Energy level is below 5J threshold
- Steel projectiles at this velocity can cause eye injuries
- Insufficient energy for skin penetration or glass breaking
- Range calculation of 80m is optimistic and assumes perfect efficiency

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible? YES** 
   - Score: 26/34 (≥25 threshold met)
   - Sufficient specifications provided for frame material, band dimensions, projectile specs, and draw length
   - Missing details: fork gap, weight, fabrication method, and attachment specifics

2. **Dangerous? NO (but caution advised)**
   - Level 1 danger classification
   - Primary risk: **Eye injury** - safety glasses essential
   - Not capable of skin penetration or severe injury at calculated energy levels
   - **Safety recommendation**: Treat as requiring eye protection for operator and bystanders

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES:

**Strengths of Design:**
- Excellent quantitative analysis with engineering calculations
- Comprehensive material specifications with mechanical properties
- Clear energy transfer calculations

**Weaknesses:**
- Fork gap not specified (critical for projectile clearance)
- No fabrication/manufacturing details
- Attachment methods vaguely described
- Actual efficiency losses not accounted for (real-world KE likely lower than calculated)
