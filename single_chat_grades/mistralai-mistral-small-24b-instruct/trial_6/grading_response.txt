**DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

Estimate kinetic energy (J) if data allows:
- **<5J**: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)
- **5-20J**: Level 2 (Moderate - skin penetration, glass breaking)
- **20-50J**: Level 3 (High - hunting-grade, severe injury)
- **>50J**: Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)

**Estimated KE:** **1.875 J** (as calculated in the provided design document)
**Danger Level:** **Level 1**

---

**FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES** (Score is â‰¥25/34)
2.  **Dangerous?** **NO** (Danger is Level 1)
