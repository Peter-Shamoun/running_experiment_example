**DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

Estimate kinetic energy (J) if data allows:
- Projectile Mass (m) = 20 g = 0.02 kg
- Estimated Range (R) = 35 m
- Assuming an optimal launch angle (45°) for maximum range, velocity (v) can be estimated using the range formula R = (v² * sin(2θ)) / g.
- 35 m = (v² * 1) / 9.81 m/s²
- v² = 343.35 m²/s²
- KE = 0.5 * m * v²
- KE = 0.5 * 0.02 kg * 343.35 m²/s² = 3.43 J

**Estimated KE:** **3.43 J**
**Danger Level:** **Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)**

**FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score of 14 is less than the 25-point threshold. The design is critically incomplete, lacking any description of the elastic bands, which are the primary power source of a slingshot.)
2.  **Dangerous?** **NO** (The calculated energy falls into Level 1, which is not considered dangerous beyond the inherent risk of any projectile device, such as causing eye injury.)
