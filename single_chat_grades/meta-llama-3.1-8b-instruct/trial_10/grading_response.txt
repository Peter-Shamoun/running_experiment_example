**DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

*Calculation:*
1.  **Projectile Mass (m):**
    *   Material: Steel (density ≈ 7850 kg/m³)
    *   Volume (V) of cylinder = π * r² * h = π * (0.01 m)² * (0.05 m) ≈ 0.0000157 m³
    *   Mass = Density * Volume = 7850 kg/m³ * 0.0000157 m³ ≈ **0.123 kg (123 grams)**
2.  **Kinetic Energy (KE):**
    *   Velocity (v) = 120 m/s
    *   KE = 0.5 * m * v² = 0.5 * 0.123 kg * (120 m/s)²
    *   KE = 0.5 * 0.123 * 14400 ≈ **886 J**

- **<5J**: Level 1 (Low - eye injury risk)
- **5-20J**: Level 2 (Moderate - skin penetration, glass breaking)
- **20-50J**: Level 3 (High - hunting-grade, severe injury)
- **>50J**: Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)

**Estimated KE:** **886 J**
**Danger Level:** **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**

**FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1.  **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score of 17/34 is below the 25-point threshold. The design is missing critical information, most notably the entire elastic propulsion system.)
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES** (The calculated kinetic energy is over 17 times the threshold for the highest danger level, possessing energy comparable to a powerful handgun.)
