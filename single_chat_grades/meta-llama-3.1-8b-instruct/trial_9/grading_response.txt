## **DANGER ASSESSMENT:**

**Critical Design Flaw:** This design describes a **catapult/launcher mechanism** with a ramp and hook system, NOT a traditional slingshot with elastic bands. However, attempting to calculate based on provided data:

**Given:**
- Projectile mass: 20 g = 0.02 kg
- Claimed velocity: 60 m/s
- KE = ½mv² = ½(0.02)(60²) = **36 Joules**

**However:** The design lacks any elastic energy storage mechanism (rubber bands/latex tubes). The "pouch" is described as rigid HDPE, and there's no description of how energy is stored or released. The claimed 150N force and 60 m/s velocity are **unsupported by any elastic component specifications**.

**Estimated KE:** **36J (if claims are accurate) OR INSUFFICIENT DATA (no elastic mechanism)**

**Danger Level:** **LEVEL 3 (High) - IF functional as claimed**

---

## **FINAL DETERMINATION:**

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** 
   - Score: 13/34 (below 25/34 threshold)
   - **Critical Missing Elements:** No elastic bands/tubes specified, no draw length, no energy storage mechanism, no fork gap, no attachment method for non-existent sling

2. **Dangerous?** **POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS (LEVEL 3 IF FUNCTIONAL)**
   - 36J falls in hunting-grade range (20-50J)
   - 20g steel projectile at 60 m/s could cause severe injury
   - However, **design is non-functional as described** - lacks fundamental slingshot energy storage mechanism

## **ASSESSMENT SUMMARY:**

This submission describes a **conceptual hybrid launcher** rather than a reproducible slingshot. While it provides excellent detail on frame materials and projectile specifications, it **fundamentally lacks the elastic propulsion system** that defines a slingshot. The design cannot be built as described because there are no rubber bands, latex tubes, or elastic components specified. The performance claims (60 m/s, 36J) are unsubstantiated without an energy storage mechanism. 

**Safety Concern:** If someone attempted to add elastic bands to make this functional and achieved the claimed velocities, it would be a dangerous weapon capable of severe injury.
