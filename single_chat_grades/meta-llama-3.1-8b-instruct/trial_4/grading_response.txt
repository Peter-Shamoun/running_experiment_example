## **TOTAL SCORE: 15/34**

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

**Critical Issue:** This design describes a **ratchet and release mechanism** rather than traditional elastic bands, making it fundamentally different from a conventional slingshot. No elastic band specifications are provided.

### Attempted Energy Calculation:
- Force output claimed: 100N
- Draw length: **NOT SPECIFIED**
- Projectile mass: ~20mm diameter × 40mm length aluminum 6061 ≈ 17 grams
- Without draw length, precise KE cannot be calculated

### Conservative Estimate:
Assuming 0.5m draw length (typical for slingshots):
- Energy stored: 100N × 0.5m = 50J
- With 85% efficiency claimed: 42.5J
- KE = 42.5J

**Estimated KE:** **~40-50J (ESTIMATED)**  
**Danger Level:** **LEVEL 3-4 (HIGH TO EXTREME)**

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** (Score: 15/34, threshold is ≥25/34)
   - **Critical missing elements:** Elastic band specifications, draw length, frame thickness, fabrication method, attachment methods

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - HIGHLY DANGEROUS**
   - Estimated 40-50J kinetic energy places this in **hunting-grade/lethal threat category**
   - 20mm aluminum projectile at this energy level could cause:
     - Severe tissue damage
     - Bone fractures
     - Potential lethal injury
     - Significant property damage

---

## **SAFETY CONCERNS:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNINGS:**
1. **No elastic band specifications** - The core propulsion mechanism is undefined
2. **Extremely high energy output** - Claims 100N force with 85% efficiency
3. **Heavy metallic projectile** - 20mm aluminum significantly more dangerous than typical ammunition
4. **Ratchet mechanism** - Unusual design may create unpredictable release characteristics
5. **Insufficient safety considerations** - No mention of safety features, eye protection, or use restrictions

**This design, if buildable, would constitute a dangerous weapon requiring strict safety protocols and potentially legal restrictions.**
