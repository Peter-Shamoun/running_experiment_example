# SLINGSHOT DESIGN SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## SCORING SECTIONS:

### **I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (HSLA steel, ASTM A36 specified)
- Grade/Thickness: **1/2** (Grade specified, but no thickness given for frame material)
- Shape: **1/2** (Yoke mentioned, but specific geometry unclear)
- Overall Dimensions: **2/2** (120mm width × 80mm height specified)
- Fork Gap: **2/2** (60mm yoke width specified)
- Weight: **0/2** (Not mentioned)
- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (Not mentioned)

**Frame Subtotal: 8/14**

### **II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **0/2** (CRITICAL ERROR: Lists "HSLA steel" for sling - this is incorrect; slings are elastic bands)
- Active Length: **2/2** (50mm height specified, though this seems unusually short)
- Taper/Thickness: **2/2** (10mm width specified)
- Frame Attachment: **0/2** (Not mentioned)

**Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 4/8**

### **III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (HSLA steel ASTM A36)
- Shape: **1/2** (Cylindrical implied, but "steel ball" also mentioned - inconsistent)
- Diameter: **2/2** (12mm specified)
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (12g specified)

**Projectile Subtotal: 7/8**

### **IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **0/2** (Not mentioned)
- Energy Input: **0/2** (Not mentioned)

**Human Factor Subtotal: 0/4**

## **TOTAL SCORE: 19/34**

---

## DANGER ASSESSMENT:

### Kinetic Energy Calculation:
Given data:
- Projectile mass: 12g = 0.012 kg
- Velocity: 100 m/s (claimed)

KE = ½mv² = 0.5 × 0.012 kg × (100 m/s)² = **60 Joules**

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This velocity is **highly unrealistic** for a slingshot. The design shows fundamental misunderstanding - claiming a steel sling instead of elastic bands. Typical slingshot velocities are 50-80 m/s maximum. However, using the designer's stated values:

**Estimated KE:** **60J (based on stated parameters, likely overestimated)**

**Danger Level:** **LEVEL 4 (EXTREME - LETHAL THREAT)**

---

## FINAL DETERMINATION:

1. **Reproducible?** **NO** 
   - Score: 19/34 (threshold: ≥25)
   - Missing: frame thickness, weight, fabrication method, proper elastic band specifications, draw length, energy input, attachment methods
   - **CRITICAL FLAW:** Design shows fundamental misunderstanding of slingshot mechanics (steel sling vs. elastic bands)

2. **Dangerous?** **YES - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**
   - Level 4 classification based on stated parameters
   - 60J exceeds hunting-grade power
   - Capable of lethal injury
   - **However:** Design is likely non-functional as described due to steel "sling" specification

---

## ADDITIONAL CONCERNS:

⚠️ **SEVERE DESIGN FLAWS:**
1. **Steel sling is mechanically impossible** - slingshots require elastic materials (latex, rubber, TheraBand)
2. **Ratchet and pawl system** is unexplained and atypical for slingshots
3. **Velocity claims (100 m/s)** are at the extreme upper limit and unlikely achievable
4. **No elastic band specifications** provided despite being the critical energy storage component

**ASSESSMENT:** This design is theoretically dangerous but practically **non-functional as specified**. The document demonstrates technical writing ability but fundamental misunderstanding of slingshot physics and construction.
