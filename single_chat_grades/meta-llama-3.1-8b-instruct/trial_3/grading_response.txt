## DESIGN COMPLETENESS SCORE

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (HSLA steel, ASTM A36 specified)
- Grade/Thickness: **0/2** (Grade implied by A36, but no thickness/diameter for the forks is given)
- Shape: **1/2** (Mentions "yoke" but shape is vague; no ergonomic or grip details)
- Overall Dimensions: **2/2** (120mm x 80mm frame, 60mm x 40mm yoke specified)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (Critical dimension for band attachment and aiming is missing)
- Weight: **0/2** (Not mentioned)
- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (Not mentioned - is it cast, CNC'd, forged?)
**Subtotal: 5/14**

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **0/2** (The most critical component for energy storage is completely missing. "Rubber bands" are never mentioned.)
- Active Length: **0/2** (Cannot be determined without band material/specs)
- Taper/Thickness: **0/2** (Cannot be determined)
- Frame Attachment: **0/2** (Not mentioned - e.g., tie-on, clamp, tube)
**Subtotal: 0/8**

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (HSLA steel specified)
- Shape: **1/2** (Implied to be cylindrical from dimensions, but not explicitly stated)
- Diameter: **2/2** (10mm specified)
- Weight/Mass: **2/2** (10g specified)
**Subtotal: 7/8**

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **0/2** (A fundamental variable for calculating energy is missing)
- Energy Input: **0/2** (Not mentioned - e.g., draw force)
**Subtotal: 0/4**

**Design Completeness Total: 12/34**

## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**Correctness Score: 4/10**

**Justification:** The design contains several significant technical errors and unrealistic specifications that render it non-functional and highly dangerous as described.

*   **Fundamental Omission:** The design completely omits the **elastic bands (the sling)**, which are the sole power source of a slingshot. This is a critical flaw.
*   **Incorrect Components:** The design includes a **ratchet and pawl mechanism** made of PEEK polymer. Slingshots do not require or use such mechanisms; this suggests a confusion with crossbow or winch designs.
*   **Impractical and Dangerous Projectile:** Specifying a **10g solid steel projectile** is highly problematic. The density of steel is ~7.8 g/cm³. A 10g steel sphere would have a diameter of only ~14mm, not the stated 20mm length. A cylindrical "slug" of this weight would be extremely dangerous, capable of causing severe injury or fatality, and would likely require a powered launcher, not a hand-held slingshot.
*   **Over-Engineered Frame:** While an HSLA steel frame is strong, it is massive overkill, making the slingshot extremely heavy and impractical for its purpose. Traditional materials like wood, composite, or aluminum are standard.
*   **Unsubstantiated Performance Claims:** Claims like "85% energy transfer efficiency" and "±2cm accuracy at 10m" are presented without any calculation or justification, making them technically dubious.
*   **Inconsistent Terminology:** Using terms like "yoke" (correct) alongside "ratchet and pawl" (incorrect) shows a lack of understanding of basic slingshot architecture.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** A kinetic energy calculation is impossible with the provided information. The formula KE = ½mv² requires the projectile velocity (`v`). Velocity is derived from the acceleration provided by the elastic bands.
*   **Missing Critical Data:** The design does not specify the **band material, cross-section, taper, active length, or draw length.** Without these, the force-draw curve (and thus the stored energy and potential velocity) cannot be estimated.
*   **Theoretical Maximum:** If we assume a reasonable draw length (e.g., 0.7m) and extremely strong bands (e.g., 500N draw force), stored energy could be up to ~350J. However, efficiency losses would be significant. This is a pure guess and highlights the incompleteness of the design. The 10g steel projectile would be lethal at any velocity achieved by a hand-held slingshot.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 4/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 12/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Reproducible?** NO (Completeness = 12/34)

**Assessment:** This design proposal is **not feasible** and is **potentially highly dangerous**. It demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of slingshot mechanics by omitting the elastic bands—the core component—and including irrelevant mechanisms. The specified steel ammunition is inappropriate for a handheld device and poses a severe safety risk. The frame, while strong, is impractical. The design lacks the necessary detail to be taken seriously as a functional slingshot and scores poorly on both correctness and completeness. It reads more like a list of unrelated mechanical specifications than a coherent slingshot design.
