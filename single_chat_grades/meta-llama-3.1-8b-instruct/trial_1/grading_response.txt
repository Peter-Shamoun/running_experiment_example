## DESIGN COMPLETENESS SCORE

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (HSLA steel is specific)
- Grade/Thickness: **2/2** (3mm thickness specified)
- Shape: **0/2** (Only "frame" is mentioned; no description of shape, e.g., fork-style, wrist-rocket, etc.)
- Overall Dimensions: **2/2** (250mm L x 100mm W x 50mm H provided)
- Fork Gap: **0/2** (Not mentioned. Critical for band attachment and aiming.)

- Fabrication Method: **0/2** (Not mentioned.)
*Frame Subtotal: 6/14*

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **0/2** (The most critical component, the elastic bands, are completely omitted. The "pouch" is described, but not the bands.)
- Active Length: **0/2** (Cannot be determined without bands.)

## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**Correctness Score: 2/10**

**Justification:** The design is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a severe misunderstanding of slingshot mechanics and basic physics.

1.  **Missing Critical Components:** The design completely omits the elastic bands (the "sling"), which are the sole power source of a slingshot. Without them, the device cannot function.
2.  **Incorrect Use of Components:** The described "ramp" and "hook" are not standard slingshot components and suggest a confusion with a different projectile weapon, like a catapult or crossbow. A slingshot operates by stretching elastic material, not by launching projectiles off a ramp.
3.  **Nonsensical Physics and Material Choices:**
    *   The energy transfer efficiency of "85%" is a meaningless number with no basis in the provided design.
    *   The range calculation `R = (v^2 * sin(2θ)) / g` is a standard projectile motion formula but is used here without a stated velocity (`v`), making the "45 meter" claim completely unsubstantiated.
    *   The trajectory equation `y = (v^2 * sin(2θ)) / (2 * g * x)` is **incorrect**. The standard formula is `y = x*tan(θ) - (g*x²)/(2*v²*cos²(θ))`.
    *   The "Force Output" of "150 N" is presented without any calculation or context. Force isn't an "output" of a slingshot; energy and velocity are.
    *   The material choices are wildly inappropriate. A 3mm thick **steel frame** would be incredibly heavy and cumbersome. A High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pouch would be far too stiff and inflexible to hold a projectile effectively. Launching a 10g steel projectile is extremely dangerous and would require specialized, heavy-duty bands, which are not specified.

The design is incoherent and not feasible as a functional slingshot.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** It is impossible to estimate the kinetic energy because the single most important variable for the calculation is missing: the elastic bands.
The kinetic energy is derived from the potential energy stored in the stretched bands, calculated as `PE = ½ * k * (draw_length)²` for each band (where `k` is the spring constant). Without knowing:
*   The type, size, or number of bands
*   Their spring constant (`k`) or equivalent force
*   The draw length
...any energy estimate would be pure speculation.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 2/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 14/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Reproducible?** NO (Completeness < 25/34)

**Assessment:** This "Apex" design proposal is critically incomplete and technically unsound. It omits the core power component (the bands) and introduces non-functional elements (ramp, hook) based on a misunderstanding of the weapon's principle of operation. The provided physics calculations are erroneous and the material choices are impractical and dangerous. This design could not be built or tested as described. It receives a very low score for correctness and a failing score for completeness due to the omission of essential specifications.
