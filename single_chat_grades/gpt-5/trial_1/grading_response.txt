## DESIGN COMPLETENESS SCORE

Assign points based on detail specificity:
- **2 points**: Quantitative, specific (e.g., "10mm oak wood," "20mm latex bands")
- **1 point**: Mentioned but vague (e.g., "wood," "rubber bands")
- **0 points**: Missing

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **0/2**
- Grade/Thickness: **0/2**
- Shape: **0/2**
- Overall Dimensions: **0/2**
- Fork Gap: **0/2**
- Weight: **0/2**
- Fabrication Method: **0/2**

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **0/2**
- Active Length: **0/2**
- Taper/Thickness: **0/2**
- Frame Attachment: **0/2**

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **0/2**
- Shape: **1/2** (Mentions "near-spherical projectiles" but as a general concept, not a specific design choice.)
- Diameter: **0/2**
- Weight/Mass: **0/2**

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **0/2**
- Energy Input: **0/2**

**Design Completeness Total: 1/34**

## CORRECTNESS SCORE

Evaluate the technical accuracy and feasibility of the design.

**Correctness Score: 10/10**

**Justification:** The response does not provide a specific design. Instead, it provides a comprehensive and highly accurate engineering framework for designing, analyzing, and optimizing a slingshot. The physics principles (stored energy, kinetic energy, ballistics), material science concepts (elastomer behavior, hysteresis, fatigue), and engineering methodologies (modal analysis, sensitivity analysis, multi-objective optimization) are all technically sound, advanced, and correctly applied to the problem. While it fails to be a "design," the information it provides is of the highest technical correctness. It is a perfect academic guide to the problem.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The response provides the correct formulas for calculating kinetic energy (E = ½mv²) and stored potential energy but gives no specific values for any of the required variables. There is no information on projectile mass, band type, draw length, or exit velocity, making any energy calculation impossible.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 10/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 1/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: INSUFFICIENT DATA**

**Reproducible?** **NO** (Completeness score of 1/34 is below the 25/34 threshold)
**Assessment:** The response is not a slingshot design but rather a high-level, academically rigorous framework for how to engineer one. It scores perfectly on technical correctness due to its sound application of physics and engineering principles. However, it scores virtually zero on design completeness because it intentionally and explicitly avoids providing any specific, quantifiable details, instead focusing on methodology. Consequently, the design is not reproducible, and its performance cannot be calculated.
