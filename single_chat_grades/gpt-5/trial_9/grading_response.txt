## CORRECTNESS SCORE

**Correctness Score: 8/10**

**Justification:** The design is fundamentally sound and feasible with mostly appropriate material choices.
*   **Strengths:** Oak is a classic, strong, and suitable wood for a frame. Latex tubing is the correct modern material for bands, and the specified dimensions are realistic. Specifying a steel spherical projectile is excellent, as its mass can be accurately calculated.
*   **Minor Technical Issues:** The design omits several critical details that would be necessary for safe and predictable performance:
    1.  The **frame attachment method** for the bands is unspecified. A weak knot or insecure clamp is a common failure point.
    2.  The lack of a specified **draw length** and **fork gap** makes it impossible to know the band stretch ratio, which is the primary factor determining stored energy and velocity.
    3.  While the frame shape is described, no ergonomic details (e.g., handle grip, palm swell) are mentioned, which are important for control and safety.

## ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: ~5.5 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:**
While the design lacks a stated draw length, we can make a reasonable estimate based on standard slingshot principles.

1.  **Projectile Mass:** An 8mm diameter steel sphere has a volume of `4/3 * π * (0.4cm)³ ≈ 0.268 cm³`. The density of steel is ~7.8 g/cm³. Mass = `0.268 cm³ * 7.8 g/cm³ = **2.09 grams** (0.00209 kg)`.
2.  **Band Energy Storage:** The bands are latex tubing, 20cm long and 20mm wide (presumably flat width, so ~10mm internal diameter). For a typical slingshot, a safe and efficient stretch ratio is 3.5x to 4x the resting length. Assuming a draw length of ~70cm (4x the band length), this is a reasonable and common value.
3.  **Velocity Estimate:** Based on comparable slingshot designs with similar band mass and projectile mass, a velocity of **~73 m/s** is a realistic estimate.
4.  **Kinetic Energy Calculation:**
    `KE = ½ * m * v²`
    `KE = ½ * 0.00209 kg * (73 m/s)²`
    `KE = ½ * 0.00209 * 5329`
    `KE = ½ * 11.13`
    `KE = **5.565 Joules**`

This energy level is typical for a light steel projectile and is sufficient for target shooting but has relatively low lethality risk compared to more powerful setups. **This estimate is highly dependent on the assumed draw length.** A longer or shorter draw would drastically change the result.

## FINAL SUMMARY

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 8/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 18/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: ~5.5 Joules**

**Reproducible?** NO (Completeness < 25/34)
**Assessment:** This is a reasonable and fundamentally correct design for a light-to-medium power slingshot. The core components are well-specified, making it technically feasible. However, the design is **not reproducible** as provided due to critical missing details, primarily the band attachment method, fork gap, and draw length. The estimated kinetic energy is low, placing it in a relatively safe category for responsible use, but the lack of a specified draw length is a significant safety omission, as overstretching the bands could lead to premature failure.
