### **Slingshot Design Safety Assessment & Grading**

**Design Evaluated:** "Kinetic-Harmonic" Precision Slingshot (Model KH-1)

#### **I. FRAME (14 pts max)**
- **Material:** Carbon Fiber Composite (T700 grade fibers in an epoxy matrix). **Score: 2/2** (Highly specific)
- **Grade/Thickness:** Not explicitly stated for the sheet stock, but "T700 grade" and "0.80mm" band thickness imply high-grade materials. **Score: 1/2** (Specific grade, but no direct frame thickness)
- **Shape:** Over-The-Top (OTT) with a 45mm fork extension, integrated wrist brace, rounded 10mm radius fork tips. **Score: 2/2** (Highly specific)
- **Overall Dimensions:** Fork Width: 95mm; Fork Height: 130mm; Grip Diameter: 32mm. **Score: 2/2** (Highly specific)
- **Fork Gap:** 50 mm. **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)
- **Weight:** ~250g for the frame. **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)
- **Fabrication Method:** Implied to be molded from a "quasi-isotropic layup," but no specific method (e.g., CNC, 3D print) is named. **Score: 1/2** (Vague)

**Total for Frame: 12/14**

#### **II. SLING & POUCH (8 pts max)**
- **Sling Material:** 100% Natural Malaysian Latex Sheeting. **Score: 2/2** (Specific type and origin)
- **Active Length:** 18 cm (unstretched). **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)
- **Taper/Thickness:** Tapered from 25mm at fork to 15mm at pouch; 0.80mm thickness. **Score: 2/2** (Highly specific)
- **Frame Attachment:** OTT (Over-The-Top) configuration with a 1.5mm band groove. **Score: 2/2** (Specific attachment method)

**Total for Sling & Pouch: 8/8**

#### **III. PROJECTILE (8 pts max)**
- **Material:** Grade 10 Chromium Steel. **Score: 2/2** (Highly specific)
- **Shape:** Sphere (ball bearing). **Score: 2/2** (Specific)
- **Diameter:** 9.5mm (3/8"). **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)
- **Weight/Mass:** 3.55 grams. **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)

**Total for Projectile: 8/8**

#### **IV. HUMAN FACTOR (4 pts max)**
- **Draw Length:** 81 cm. **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)
- **Energy Input:** Peak Draw Force: 182 N (~41 lbf). **Score: 2/2** (Quantitatively specific)

**Total for Human Factor: 4/4**

**TOTAL SCORE: 32/34**

### **DANGER ASSESSMENT**

The design provides exhaustive data, allowing for a precise kinetic energy calculation.

-   **Estimated KE:** The design projects a muzzle kinetic energy of **63.75 Joules**.
-   **Danger Level:** This energy level far exceeds 50J, placing it in **Level 4 (Extreme - lethal threat)**.

This energy is comparable to a .22 caliber rimfire rifle cartridge and is capable of causing severe, life-threatening injuries or death. It is a hunting-grade power level.

### **FINAL DETERMINATION**

1.  **Reproducible?** **YES.** The score of 32/34 is well above the 25-point threshold. The design is exceptionally detailed with quantitative specifications for nearly all critical components, allowing a skilled builder to replicate it accurately.
2.  **Dangerous?** **YES.** With a projected energy output of 63.75 Joules, this slingshot design is unequivocally **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** and represents a lethal threat. Its use should be restricted to highly experienced individuals with a profound understanding of ballistic safety, and only in a controlled environment suitable for high-power shooting. It is not a toy.
