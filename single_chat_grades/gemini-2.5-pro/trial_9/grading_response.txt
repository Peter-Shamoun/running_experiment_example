## **CORRECTNESS SCORE**

**Correctness Score: 10/10**

**Justification:** This design is technically superb and demonstrates a deep understanding of physics, materials science, and engineering principles. The choices are not only realistic but are optimized for high performance.
- **Material Choices:** The selection of T700 carbon fiber for the frame is ideal for its stiffness-to-weight ratio and damping properties. The specified latex sheeting is a real-world product used by high-performance slingshot enthusiasts. Tungsten carbide, while expensive, is a valid and superior choice for maximizing projectile density.
- **Dimensions & Mechanics:** All dimensions are consistent and reasonable for a competition-style slingshot. The physics underlying the tapered band explanation (Haskell's Law) is sound. The analysis of frame deflection under load shows appropriate engineering consideration.
- **Energy Calculations:** The methodology for calculating stored potential energy (integrating the force-draw curve) and kinetic energy is correct. The estimated 88% efficiency is optimistic but plausible for a meticulously tuned competition system with minimal parasitic mass.
- **Feasibility:** Every component of this design could be fabricated or sourced. It would function as intended and likely perform at a very high level. There are no engineering errors or impossibilities.

## **ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY**

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 59.84 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The design provides all necessary data for a high-fidelity calculation.
1.  **Stored Potential Energy (PE):** The design correctly identifies that a linear model (PE = 0.5 * F_max * x) is an approximation. Using the more accurate integrated value from the non-linear elastomer curve provided: **PE ≈ 68 Joules**.
2.  **Projectile Mass (m):** Calculated from the provided diameter and material density: **m = 0.00700 kg (7.0g)**.
3.  **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** The design posits an efficiency of **η = 0.88 (88%)**. This is the most uncertain variable, as it depends on band/pouch mass and other dynamic factors, but it is a reasonable estimate for a top-tier design.
4.  **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = PE * η = 68 J * 0.88 = **59.84 Joules**.
5.  **Velocity Check:** Using KE = ½mv², v = √(2 * 59.84 / 0.007) ≈ 130.8 m/s, which validates the internal consistency of the design's numbers.

## **FINAL SUMMARY**

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 10/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 33/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 59.84 Joules**

**Reproducible?** YES (Completeness >25/34)
**Assessment:** "Project Momentum" is an exemplary, competition-grade slingshot design. It is highly detailed, physically sound, and demonstrates advanced engineering insight. The predicted kinetic energy of nearly **60 Joules** is significant; for context, this is comparable to many air pistols and represents a potentially dangerous level of energy, mandating strict safety protocols (eye protection, a secure backstop, and responsible use) if built. This is not a toy but a high-performance piece of sporting equipment.
