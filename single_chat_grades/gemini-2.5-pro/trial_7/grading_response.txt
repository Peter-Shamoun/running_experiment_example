### **CORRECTNESS SCORE**

**Correctness Score: 9/10**

**Justification:** The design is highly accurate, well-engineered, and demonstrates a strong understanding of physics, material science, and mechanical engineering principles. The choices are not just stated but are justified with sound reasoning and quantitative analysis.

- **Material Choices:** Excellent. 7075-T6 aluminum is a premium, realistic choice for a high-performance frame. TheraBand Gold is the industry standard for bands. Grade 100 steel bearings are a common and effective projectile.
- **Dimensions and Measurements:** All provided dimensions are consistent, realistic, and appropriate for the stated goal of a high-power, precise tool. The 90mm fork gap is a reasonable width for an OTT design.
- **Technical Accuracy:** The stress analysis on the frame is correct and shows an immense safety factor. The energy storage calculation, while an approximation, uses a valid methodology (average force over draw distance) for estimating the potential energy in a non-linear elastic band. The efficiency factor of 75% for tapered bands is a reasonable, if slightly optimistic, estimate for a well-designed system. The subsequent kinetic energy and velocity calculations are mathematically correct.
- **Minor Deduction:** The one minor issue is the optimistic energy transfer efficiency (η). While tapered bands are more efficient, 75% is at the very high end of what is achievable; a range of 65-70% might be more conservative for a real-world calculation. This is a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptionally well-reasoned design.

### **ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY**

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 52.8 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The design provides a clear and logical calculation path:
1.  **Stored Energy (PE):** The product of the average draw force (88 N, derived from 55% of the peak 160 N force) and the draw length (0.8 m) results in **70.4 J** of potential energy stored in the bands.
2.  **Projectile Energy (KE):** The design applies an estimated energy transfer efficiency of 75% to the stored energy. Therefore, KE = 70.4 J * 0.75 = **52.8 J**.

This value is derived from the design's own parameters and is a credible estimate for the proposed system. For context, **52.8 Joules is a very high energy output for a slingshot**, exceeding the muzzle energy of many air pistols and approaching that of some lower-powered air rifles. This places it firmly in the high-power category.

## **FINAL SUMMARY**

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 9/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 28/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 52.8 Joules**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness > 25/34)
While minor details like the exact fabrication method and frame weight are missing, the design provides sufficiently specific quantitative data for a skilled machinist and slingshot enthusiast to reproduce this device accurately.

**Assessment:**
The "Artemis" design is an outstanding, professional-grade engineering proposal for a high-performance slingshot. It is technically sound, meticulously detailed, and based on correct physical principles. Its calculated kinetic energy output of **~53 Joules categorizes it as a potentially dangerous weapon capable of causing serious injury or penetrating skin and soft tissue.** This design is not a toy; it is a precision instrument that demands the utmost respect for safety protocols, including the use of protective eyewear for the shooter and any bystanders, and a backstop capable of safely absorbing the significant energy of the projectile.
