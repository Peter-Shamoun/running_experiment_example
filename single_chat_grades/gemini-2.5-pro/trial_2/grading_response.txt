## **CORRECTNESS SCORE**

**I. Physical Feasibility (6 pts max)**
- Humanly Possible: **2/2** (A 150N (~33.7 lbf) draw force is significant but well within the capability of an average adult male. The design is ergonomic to manage this force.)
- Follows Laws of Physics: **2/2** (All calculations for stress, energy, and velocity are correctly applied and adhere to fundamental physics principles.)
- Structurally Sound: **2/2** (The stress analysis shows a massive Factor of Safety (~25), proving the frame will not fail. Band elongation (400%) is within the material's capability (>600%).
**Physical Feasibility Subtotal: 6/6**

**II. Material Appropriateness (4 pts max)**
- Material Properties Match Use: **2/2** (7075-T6 Al is an excellent choice for a strong, lightweight frame. TheraBand Gold latex is a proven material for high-performance bands. Steel ammo is suitable.)
- Material Availability/Realism: **2/2** (All specified materials are real, commercially available products.)
**Material Appropriateness Subtotal: 4/4**

**III. Dimensional Consistency (4 pts max)**
- Dimensions are Internally Consistent: **2/2** (All provided dimensions work together logically. The 95mm fork gap comfortably accommodates the 9.5mm projectile and pouch.)
- Scale is Appropriate: **2/2** (The scale is appropriate for a handheld, high-power slingshot. Nothing is comically oversized or undersized.)
**Dimensional Consistency Subtotal: 4/4**

**IV. Functional Viability (4 pts max)**
- Design Would Function as Intended: **2/2** (The OTT design, tapered bands, lightweight pouch, and rigid frame are all recognized features of high-performance slingshots and would work together effectively.)
- Specifications Support Claimed Performance: **1/2** (The energy storage calculation (60J) is correct based on the provided *k* and *x*. The claimed 85% efficiency is **highly optimistic** for a slingshot. Typical efficiencies for even well-designed models are often closer to 60-70%. This inflates the velocity claim.)
**Functional Viability Subtotal: 3/4**

**Correctness Total: 17/18**

**Justification:** The design is exceptionally well-engineered and physically sound. The only significant issue is the overly optimistic assumption of 85% energy transfer efficiency, which is not supported by typical slingshot performance data and slightly undermines the velocity claim.

## **ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY**

### **Original Model's Claimed Kinetic Energy**
**Original Model's KE Claim: 51 Joules** (After accounting for claimed 85% efficiency)

### **Grading Model's Independent Kinetic Energy Estimate**
**Grading Model's KE Estimate: 36 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:**
The original calculation for stored potential energy is correct:
$U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} (187.5 \text{ N/m}) (0.8 \text{ m})^2 = 60 \text{ J}$.

However, the 85% efficiency claim is the critical point. A review of empirical data and technical discussions on high-performance slingshots indicates that an efficiency of **60%** is a more realistic and achievable upper limit for a well-designed taper-band system, accounting for parasitic mass and hysteresis.

Using this more conservative and standard efficiency:
$KE = U \times \eta = 60 \text{ J} \times 0.60 = 36 \text{ J}$.

Recalculating the muzzle velocity with this adjusted KE:
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 36 \text{ J}}{0.0035 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{20571 \frac{m^2}{s^2}} \approx 143.4 \text{ m/s} \text{ (471 fps)}$.

This velocity, while still extremely powerful and dangerous, is more aligned with the upper end of known high-performance slingshot capabilities.

## **FINAL SUMMARY**

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 17/18**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 30/34**
**SCORE 3 - Original Model's KE Claim: 51 Joules**
**SCORE 4 - Grading Model's KE Estimate: 36 Joules**

**Reproducible?** **YES** (Completeness = 30/34, which is >25/34)

**Assessment:** The "Project Artemis" design is outstandingly detailed, well-reasoned, and physically feasible. It demonstrates a strong understanding of engineering principles, material science, and slingshot mechanics. The design is absolutely reproducible by a skilled machinist. Its primary flaw is an overestimation of system efficiency, leading to a ~40% overestimate of projectile energy (51J claimed vs. 36J estimated). Even with this correction, the slingshot is a **highly dangerous weapon** capable of generating 36 Joules of energy, which far exceeds the typical 15-20 J threshold for serious injury and is sufficient for hunting small game. This design necessitates extreme caution, a high level of user skill, and must be used only in a safe, controlled environment with appropriate personal protective equipment.
