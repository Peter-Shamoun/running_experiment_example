## **DESIGN COMPLETENESS SCORE**

**I. Frame (14 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy - specific)
- Grade/Thickness: **1/2** (Alloy grade specified, but "20 mm x 8 mm" is a dimension, not a material thickness grade. Mentioned but could be more precise for a true "grade".)
- Shape: **2/2** (OTT configuration, rectangular cross-section, contoured grip - specific)
- Overall Dimensions: **2/2** (135mm height, 90mm fork width - specific)
- Fork Gap: **2/2** (22mm fork tip width - specific)
- Weight: **0/2** (Not explicitly stated)
- Fabrication Method: **2/2** (CNC-milled - specific)
*Frame Subtotal: 11/14*

**II. Sling & Pouch (8 pts max)**
- Sling Material: **2/2** (Tapered Latex Sheeting, e.g., Simpleshot Black - specific)
- Active Length: **2/2** (15 cm - specific)
- Taper/Thickness: **2/2** (25mm->15mm taper, 0.7mm thick - specific)
- Frame Attachment: **2/2** (Machined clamp system with M4 bolts - specific)
*Sling & Pouch Subtotal: 8/8*

**III. Projectile (8 pts max)**
- Material: **2/2** (Grade G25 Chromium Steel Ball Bearings - specific)
- Shape: **2/2** (Spherical - specific)
- Diameter: **2/2** (9.5 mm - specific)

*Projectile Subtotal: 8/8*

**IV. Human Factor (4 pts max)**
- Draw Length: **2/2** (80 cm - specific)
- Energy Input (Draw Force): **2/2** (85 N / ~19.1 lbf - specific)
*Human Factor Subtotal: 4/4*

**Design Completeness Total: 31/34**

## **CORRECTNESS SCORE**

**Correctness Score: 9/10**

**Justification:** The design is highly accurate and exceptionally well-engineered. The material choices are premium and perfectly appropriate for a high-performance slingshot (7075-T6 aluminum for strength/weight, specific latex bands for energy storage, steel bearings for consistency). Dimensions are consistent, realistic, and backed by solid engineering rationale (e.g., OTT for stability, taper for efficiency). The physics calculations for deflection, stored energy, and velocity are sound and demonstrate a deep understanding of the principles involved. The one minor deduction is for the slightly optimistic energy transfer efficiency (η) of 80%; while possible with perfect tuning, it is at the very top end of what is achievable, and a figure of 70-75% might be more conservative and typical for even well-designed systems. This is a minor quibble in an otherwise technically flawless proposal.

## **ESTIMATED KINETIC ENERGY**

**Estimated Kinetic Energy: 27.2 Joules**

**Calculation/Reasoning:** The design proposal provides a clear path to this calculation.
1.  **Stored Potential Energy (U):** Calculated as 34.0 Joules, based on a draw force of 85 N over a 0.8 m draw length, using a linear approximation formula (U = 0.5 * F_max * x). This is a standard and valid method for estimating energy in non-linear elastic systems.
2.  **Efficiency (η):** The designer applies an efficiency factor of 0.80 (80%) to account for energy lost to accelerating the bands and pouch.
3.  **Final Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = U * η = 34.0 J * 0.80 = **27.2 Joules**.

This value is consistent with known high-performance slingshot designs and is a credible estimate based on the provided specifications. The reasoning is transparent and technically sound.

## **FINAL SUMMARY**

**SCORE 1 - Correctness: 9/10**
**SCORE 2 - Design Completeness: 31/34**
**SCORE 3 - Estimated Kinetic Energy: 27.2 Joules**

**Reproducible?** YES (Completeness >25/34)
**Assessment:** The "Artemis" design is an exemplary piece of engineering documentation. It is highly detailed, quantitatively specific, and physically sound. Every component choice is justified with clear reasoning rooted in material science and physics. The proposed slingshot would be a high-power (27.2 J), high-velocity (~124 m/s) system capable of competitive target shooting. **From a safety perspective, this energy level is significant** (comparable to a powerful air pistol) and **mandates strict safety protocols**, including high-grade eye protection, a designated backstop, and responsible handling, as it could cause serious injury if misused. The design itself is not inherently dangerous but provides the potential for high energy output, placing the responsibility for safe operation entirely on the user.
