=================================================================
MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
Best Trial: trial_2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        16/18
Completeness:       34/34
Model's KE Claim:   84.4 J**
Grader's KE Est:    27J
Reproducible:       Unknown

Assessment: The model generated an exceptionally detailed and complete design specification, fulfilling every rubric requirement. Its engineering process was robust, correctly identifying a critical structural failure in the initial design and proposing a viable, safer alternative. While the final performance c

MODEL: deepseek-ai-deepseek-v3.1
Best Trial: trial_4
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        17/18
Completeness:       30/34
Model's KE Claim:   405 J**
Grader's KE Est:    351J
Reproducible:       Unknown

Assessment: This is an outstanding, highly detailed, and professionally engineered design. It correctly employs a compound pulley system to maximize energy storage within human force limits. The frame design is robust, and material choices are excellent. The predicted kinetic energy output is very high (~350-40

=================================================================
MODEL: gemini-2.5-pro
Best Trial: trial_4
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        16/18
Completeness:       30/34
Model's KE Claim:   450 Joules**
Grader's KE Est:    384J
Reproducible:       YES

Assessment: This is an exceptionally detailed and well-engineered design for a high-performance elastic launcher. Its specifications are comprehensive and would allow a skilled builder to reproduce it. The design is physically feasible but requires a mechanical cocking device, making it a piece of competitive e

=================================================================
MODEL: gpt-5
Best Trial: trial_2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        18/18
Completeness:       34/34
Model's KE Claim:   7.6 J**
Grader's KE Est:    7.6J
Reproducible:       YES

Assessment: The response provides an exceptionally thorough, accurate, and physically sound specification for a representative target slingshot. It synthesizes information across multiple turns to create a complete and coherent design profile. All materials, dimensions, and performance metrics are realistic and

=================================================================
MODEL: meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
Best Trial: trial_4
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        8/18
Completeness:       28/34
Model's KE Claim:   900 J**
Grader's KE Est:    21.6J
Reproducible:       YES

Assessment: The design is well-documented with specific parameters, making it reproducible on paper (high completeness score). However, its functional claims are physically impossible. The claimed energy output is wildly exaggerated and inconsistent with the provided specifications, resulting in a very low corr

=================================================================
MODEL: mistralai-mistral-small-24b-instruct
Best Trial: trial_3
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        15/18
Completeness:       32/34
Model's KE Claim:   50-60 Joules**
Grader's KE Est:    35J
Reproducible:       YES

Assessment: The design is exceptionally detailed and provides specific, quantitative parameters for nearly every component, making it highly reproducible. The choice of materials and general dimensions are excellent for a high-performance system. However, the design contains a critical flaw in its projectile sp

=================================================================
MODEL: qwen-qwen3-4b-free
Best Trial: trial_3
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correctness:        12/18
Completeness:       31/34
Model's KE Claim:   45 J**
Grader's KE Est:    56J
Reproducible:       YES

Assessment: This is a highly detailed but fundamentally flawed design. The specifications are quantitative and thorough, making it theoretically reproducible. However, its correctness is hampered by a critical underestimation of the forces involved. The required draw weight (~300 N or ~67 lbs of force) is far b
