USER PROMPT:
Thanks! The 1.125 J potential energy seems too low for a functional slingshot. Can you recalculate with a more realistic spring constant for 12mm x 1.5mm latex bands at 150mm active length stretched to 150mm draw (so total 300mm)? Also calculate the projectile kinetic energy assuming 70% efficiency and the resulting launch velocity for the 10g projectile. Please provide corrected numerical values.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
To recalculate the potential energy stored in the elastic bands and the resulting kinetic energy of the projectile, we need to use a more realistic spring constant for the latex bands. Latex bands with the given dimensions (12mm x 1.5mm) and active length (150mm) typically have a spring constant in the range of 20-30 N/m when stretched to twice their active length (300mm).

Let's use an average spring constant of 25 N/m for our calculations.

### Potential Energy Calculation

The potential energy (PE) stored in the elastic bands can be calculated using the formula:
\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \]

where:
- \( k \) is the spring constant (25 N/m)
- \( x \) is the draw length (0.15 m)

\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times (0.15)^2 \]
\[ PE = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times 0.0225 \]
\[ PE = 12.5 \times 0.0225 \]
\[ PE = 0.28125 \text{ Joules} \]

### Kinetic Energy Calculation

Assuming 70% efficiency in converting potential energy to kinetic energy, the kinetic energy (KE) of the projectile is:
\[ KE = 0.7 \times PE \]
\[ KE = 0.7 \times 0.28125 \]
\[ KE = 0.196875 \text{ Joules} \]

### Launch Velocity Calculation

The kinetic energy of the projectile can also be expressed as:
\[ KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the projectile (0.01 kg)
- \( v \) is the launch velocity

Rearranging the formula to solve for velocity:
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times KE}{m}} \]
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 0.196875}{0.01}} \]
\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{0.39375}{0.01}} \]
\[ v = \sqrt{39.375} \]
\[ v \approx 6.27 \text{ m/s} \]

### Corrected Numerical Values

- **Potential Energy (PE)**: 0.28125 Joules
- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: 0.196875 Joules
- **Launch Velocity (v)**: approximately 6.27 m/s

These values should provide a more realistic assessment of the slingshot's performance. The launch velocity of approximately 6.27 m/s is more in line with what you might expect from a functional slingshot using latex bands of the specified dimensions.
