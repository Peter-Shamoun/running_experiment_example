Using rock or steel balls instead of the ultra-lightweight aerogel projectile in the Max Power Variant of the PowerBand Slingshot would indeed be unsafe and would likely exceed the safety cap of 60 Joules (J) of kinetic energy. Here's why:

### Safety Considerations:

1. **Kinetic Energy**:
   - Kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula:
     \[
     KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
     \]
     where \( m \) is the mass of the projectile and \( v \) is its velocity.

2. **Velocity Calculation**:
   - The velocity of the projectile can be estimated using the work-energy principle, where the energy stored in the elastic bands is transferred to the projectile:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} k_{total} \Delta x^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
     \]
     Solving for \( v \):
     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{k_{total} \Delta x^2}{m}}
     \]

3. **Kinetic Energy with Rock/Steel Balls**:
   - Let's assume a rock or steel ball with a mass of 50 grams (0.05 kg).
   - Using the total force generated (542.8 N) and the total spring constant (80 N/m), we can estimate the velocity:
     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{80 \, \text{N/m} \times (0.915 \, \text{m})^2}{0.05 \, \text{kg}}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{66.62}{0.05}} \approx \sqrt{1332.4} \approx 36.5 \, \text{m/s}
     \]
   - The kinetic energy would then be:
     \[
     KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.05 \, \text{kg} \times (36.5 \, \text{m/s})^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 0.05 \times 1332.25 \approx 33.3 \, \text{J}
     \]

### Safety Cap Exceedance:

- The calculated kinetic energy of 33.3 J is below the 60 J safety cap, but this is a simplified calculation and does not account for all potential energy losses and real-world factors.
- If the mass of the projectile were increased to 100 grams (0.1 kg), the kinetic energy would be:
  \[
  KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \, \text{kg} \times (36.5 \, \text{m/s})^2 \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 0.1 \times 1332.25 \approx 66.6 \, \text{J}
  \]
  - This exceeds the 60 J safety cap.

### Additional Safety Concerns:

1. **Impact Force**:
   - The impact force of a heavier projectile traveling at high velocity can cause serious injury or damage. The impact force \( F_{impact} \) can be estimated using:
     \[
     F_{impact} = m \times a
     \]
     where \( a \) is the deceleration upon impact. For a high-velocity impact, the deceleration can be very high, leading to a significant impact force.

2. **Penetration and Fragmentation**:
   - Rock or steel balls can penetrate or fragment upon impact, posing additional risks. The high kinetic energy and velocity can cause the projectile to shatter or deform, creating sharp fragments that can cause injury.

3. **Control and Accuracy**:
   - Heavier projectiles are more difficult to control and aim accurately, increasing the risk of misfires or unintended impacts.

### Conclusion:

Using rock or steel balls in the Max Power Variant of the PowerBand Slingshot would be unsafe due to the high kinetic energy and impact force involved. Even with a mass of 50 grams, the kinetic energy approaches the safety cap, and increasing the mass further would exceed it. The potential for serious injury or damage makes the use of such projectiles inadvisable. Sticking with the ultra-lightweight aerogel projectile ensures safety while maximizing performance within the contest's guidelines.
