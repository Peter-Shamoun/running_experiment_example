### PowerBand Slingshot: Maximizing Force Output

#### General Design:
The PowerBand Slingshot is designed to maximize force output through optimized material selection, precise dimensions, and efficient energy transfer. The design features a hardwood frame, high-strength latex bands, and a lightweight projectile, all tailored to enhance performance and precision.

#### Materials Used:
1. **Frame**: Hardwood (Oak)
   - **Properties**: High strength, durability, and natural shock absorption.
2. **Elastic Bands**: Latex
   - **Properties**: High elasticity, energy storage capacity, and durability.
3. **Projectile**: High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
   - **Properties**: Lightweight, durable, and low cost.

#### Specific Measurements:
1. **Frame Dimensions**:
   - **Overall Length**: 16 inches (40.6 cm)
   - **Width (at the widest point)**: 8 inches (20.3 cm)
   - **Handle Length**: 5 inches (12.7 cm)
   - **Handle Diameter**: 1.25 inches (3.18 cm)
   - **Fork Length**: 6 inches (15.2 cm)
   - **Fork Thickness**: 0.75 inches (1.91 cm)

2. **Elastic Bands**:
   - **Thickness**: 1/8 inch (3.18 mm)
   - **Width**: 1 inch (2.54 cm)
   - **Free Length**: 8 inches (20.3 cm)
   - **Number of Bands**: 3 (for increased energy storage and redundancy)

3. **Projectile**:
   - **Mass**: 20 grams
   - **Diameter**: 0.75 inches (19.05 mm)
   - **Shape**: Spherical

#### Rationale Behind Measurements:
- **Frame**: The dimensions ensure a comfortable grip and easy aiming, with a wide fork to accommodate the elastic bands and provide stability.
- **Elastic Bands**: Using three bands in parallel increases the total energy storage capacity and provides redundancy in case one band fails.
- **Projectile**: The spherical shape minimizes air resistance and ensures consistent flight dynamics.

#### Calculations of Force Produced:
1. **Spring Constant (k) of Latex Bands**:
   - For latex bands, the spring constant can be approximated using the formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{F}{\Delta x}
     \]
     where \( F \) is the force applied and \( \Delta x \) is the displacement.
   - Assuming a typical latex band with a spring constant of approximately 10 N/m per band.

2. **Total Spring Constant**:
   - With three bands in parallel, the total spring constant \( k_{total} \) is:
     \[
     k_{total} = 3 \times 10 \, \text{N/m} = 30 \, \text{N/m}
     \]

3. **Displacement (x)**:
   - Assuming the bands are stretched to 12 inches (30.5 cm) from their free length of 8 inches (20.3 cm), the displacement \( \Delta x \) is:
     \[
     \Delta x = 30.5 \, \text{cm} - 20.3 \, \text{cm} = 10.2 \, \text{cm} = 0.102 \, \text{m}
     \]

4. **Force Produced**:
   - The force produced by the bands can be calculated using Hooke's Law:
     \[
     F = k_{total} \times \Delta x = 30 \, \text{N/m} \times 0.102 \, \text{m} = 3.06 \, \text{N}
     \]

5. **Total Force Generated**:
   - The total force generated by the PowerBand Slingshot is approximately 3.06 N per band, multiplied by the three bands:
     \[
     F_{total} = 3.06 \, \text{N} \times 3 = 9.18 \, \text{N}
     \]

#### Conclusion:
The PowerBand Slingshot is designed with optimized dimensions, materials, and components to maximize force output. With a total force generated of approximately 9.18 N, this design is well-suited for achieving maximum distance and precision in the contest. The use of hardwood for the frame, latex bands for energy storage, and a lightweight HDPE projectile ensures durability, efficiency, and repeatability.
