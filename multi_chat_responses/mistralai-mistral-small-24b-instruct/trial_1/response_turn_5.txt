### PowerBand Slingshot: Maximizing Force Output

#### General Design:
The PowerBand Slingshot is designed to maximize force output through optimized materials, dimensions, and elastic properties. The device features a high-strength plastic frame, high-energy latex rubber bands, and a spherical projectile. The ergonomic design ensures precise aiming and consistent performance.

#### Materials Used:
1. **Frame**: High-strength plastic (Polycarbonate)
   - **Properties**: High impact strength, excellent durability, and resistance to environmental factors.
2. **Elastic Bands**: Latex rubber bands
   - **Properties**: High energy storage capacity, efficient energy release, and good elasticity.
3. **Projectile**: High-density polyethylene (HDPE)
   - **Properties**: Durable, lightweight, and aerodynamic.

#### Specific Measurements:
1. **Frame Dimensions**:
   - **Overall Length**: 16 inches (40.6 cm)
   - **Overall Width**: 8 inches (20.3 cm)
   - **Handle Length**: 5 inches (12.7 cm)
   - **Fork Width**: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
   - **Fork Thickness**: 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) (increased for better stress distribution)

2. **Elastic Bands**:
   - **Thickness**: 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) (increased for higher force output)
   - **Width**: 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) (increased for higher force output)
   - **Length (unstretched)**: 8 inches (20.3 cm)
   - **Elastic Modulus**: Approximately 1.5 MPa (217 psi)

3. **Projectile**:
   - **Mass**: 25 grams (0.88 oz) (increased for better energy transfer)
   - **Diameter**: 1.25 inches (31.8 mm) (increased for better stability)
   - **Shape**: Spherical

#### Rationale:
- **Frame**: The increased fork thickness ensures better stress distribution and durability under high forces.
- **Elastic Bands**: Thicker and wider bands store more energy and generate higher forces.
- **Projectile**: A slightly heavier and larger projectile improves energy transfer and stability during flight.

#### Calculations of Force Produced:

1. **Force Generated by Elastic Bands**:
   - **Stretch Distance (x)**: Assume the bands are stretched to 12 inches (30.5 cm) for launch.
   - **Spring Constant (k)**: Derived from the elastic modulus and dimensions.
     - k = (Elastic Modulus * Cross-sectional Area) / Length
     - Cross-sectional Area = Thickness * Width = 6.4 mm * 38.1 mm = 243.84 mm²
     - k = (1.5 MPa * 243.84 mm²) / 20.3 cm = 179.4 N/m
   - **Force (F)**: F = k * x
     - F = 179.4 N/m * 0.1524 m = 27.3 N (per band)

2. **Total Force Generated**:
   - Assuming two bands are used:
     - Total Force = 2 * 27.3 N = 54.6 N

#### Conclusion:
The PowerBand Slingshot is designed to maximize force output through optimized materials, dimensions, and elastic properties. The high-strength plastic frame, thick latex rubber bands, and spherical HDPE projectile ensure efficient energy storage and transfer. The total force generated by this design is approximately 54.6 N, making it a strong contender for the competition. The ergonomic design and precise sighting mechanism further enhance its performance and repeatability.
