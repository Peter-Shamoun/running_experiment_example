   - **Depth**: 1 inch (2.54 cm)

#### Rationale Behind Measurements:

1. **Frame**:
   - The dimensions ensure a compact, ergonomic design that fits comfortably in one hand and provides a stable platform for launching.
   - Hardwood (Oak) is chosen for its high strength and durability, ensuring the frame can withstand the forces exerted by the rubber bands.

2. **Elastic Bands**:
   - The dimensions and stretch ratio are selected to maximize energy storage and force output.
   - Latex bands are chosen for their high elasticity and energy storage capacity.

3. **Projectile**:
   - The spherical shape minimizes air resistance and ensures consistent flight dynamics.
   - HDPE is chosen for its lightweight, durable, and aerodynamic properties.

#### Calculations of Force Produced:

1. **Force Produced by Elastic Bands**:
   - The force produced by the elastic bands can be calculated using Hooke's Law: F = k * x, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.
   - For latex bands, the spring constant k can be estimated using the Young's modulus (E) and the dimensions of the band:
     - k = (E * A) / L, where A is the cross-sectional area and L is the original length of the band.
     - A = width * thickness = 0.5 inches * 0.125 inches = 0.0625 in² = 0.406 cm²
     - L = 8 inches = 20.3 cm
     - E = 1.5 MPa = 1.5 * 10^6 Pa
     - k = (1.5 * 10^6 Pa * 0.406 cm²) / 20.3 cm = 29.9 N/cm
   - The displacement x is the stretch distance: x = 3 * L - L = 2 * L = 2 * 20.3 cm = 40.6 cm
   - F = k * x = 29.9 N/cm * 40.6 cm = 1214.94 N

2. **Total Force Produced**:
   - Assuming two bands are used, the total force produced is:
     - F_total = 2 * F = 2 * 1214.94 N = 2429.88 N

#### Conclusion:

The PowerBand Slingshot is designed to maximize force output through optimized materials, dimensions, and elastic properties. The hardwood frame provides a stable and durable platform, while the latex bands store and release energy efficiently. The spherical HDPE projectile ensures consistent flight dynamics and minimizes air resistance. With a total force output of approximately 2429.88 N, the PowerBand Slingshot is optimized for maximum distance and precision, making it a strong contender in the design contest.
