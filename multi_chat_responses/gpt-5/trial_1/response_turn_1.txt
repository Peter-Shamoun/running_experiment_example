Concept: Pedal-Flywheel Linear Mass Driver

Core subsystems
- Human input: Pedal/crank module with comfortable gearing so the operator can spin at steady cadence.
- Energy storage: Guarded flywheel that decouples the human input from the launch moment.
- Energy metering and transfer: Tunable clutch (or variable-ratio linkage) that meters a precise, repeatable impulse from the flywheel to the launch stage.
- Linear acceleration stage: Low-friction sled or belt-driven carriage that accelerates the projectile along a straight track before a clean, inline release.
- Aiming and release: Rigid, gimbaled mount with fine angle/azimuth adjustment and a consistent, low-variance release mechanism.
- Instrumentation: Simple indicators for stored energy and setup repeatability (e.g., flywheel speed indicator, angle/azimuth scales); purely passive/mechanical indicators are sufficient for contest compliance.

Why it excels in contest scoring
- Distance: Long, low-friction linear acceleration allows smoother energy transfer and higher exit velocity for a given human effort.
- Precision: Decoupling human effort (flywheel spin-up) from launch moment reduces shot-to-shot variation; fixed track and inline release minimize dispersion.
- Energy efficiency: Minimal peak loads and controlled slip/transfer reduce losses compared to impulsive, arm-type launchers.
- Repeatability: Launch only when stored energy and angles are within tight windows, improving consistency across attempts.
- Safety and control: Energy is stored and metered predictably, with clear opportunities to abort or bleed off before launch.

Key tradeoffs to present
- Complexity vs. performance: The clutch, flywheel, and linear stage add mechanical complexity compared to simpler spring/arm concepts.
- Mass and portability: A stable, guarded flywheel and rigid track improve accuracy but increase weight and setup time.
- Thermal/wear management: The metering interface (clutch/belt) can heat and wear under repeated shots; requires thoughtful duty cycle and materials selection.
- Spin-up time: Decoupling input from launch improves consistency but adds cycle time between shots.
- Guarding and interlocks: Robust containment and braking for the flywheel are essential, adding components but strengthening safety and reliability.
