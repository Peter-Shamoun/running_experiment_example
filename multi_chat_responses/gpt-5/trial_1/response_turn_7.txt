Short answer
- Yes, with dense projectiles like steel balls—or even irregular rocks—your “max power” slingshot model would likely be unsafe in practice and would very plausibly exceed a 60 J muzzle-energy cap in simulation. Treat it as over-cap unless you explicitly constrain the operating window.

Why it would be unsafe (qualitative)
- Energy density: High-stretch, large-cross-section elastics are designed to return a large amount of energy. Heavier projectiles extract a greater fraction of that stored energy, pushing muzzle energy upward.
- Ricochet risk (steel): Steel’s high density and elasticity mean high momentum and high coefficient of restitution on hard backstops—ricochet probability and severity rise sharply.
- Fragmentation and dispersion (rocks): Irregular shape and inclusions cause unpredictable tip-off and can spall or fragment, sending shards laterally; accuracy and repeatability degrade, risk increases.
- Lateral disturbance sensitivity: Any left/right band mismatch or asymmetric release is amplified with heavier or irregular projectiles, elevating off-axis loads and erratic trajectories.

Would it exceed 60 J?
- Likely yes for steel: In many slingshot regimes, common steel ball masses paired with high-stretch bands produce muzzle energies that surpass 60 J even without pushing every parameter to the limit. Your “max power” parameterization (long draw, high stretch, minimized losses) is explicitly tuned to deliver more than that.
- Possibly yes for rocks: Mass varies widely; even modest velocities with medium/heavy stones can cross 60 J. Irregular aerodynamics don’t reduce muzzle energy; they only hurt precision.
- Practical takeaway: If your modeled returned energy from the elastics (after hysteresis and moving-mass losses) exceeds 60 J, then any inertial match that lets the projectile capture most of that energy will put you over the cap. Your earlier “peak-force” target strongly suggests the returned energy budget is in that range or higher.

How to check in simulation (no launching)
- Compute the elastomer returned energy Ureturn from your measured force–extension curve and resilience model. If Ureturn > 60 J, your system can exceed the cap with suitable projectile mass.
- Run a parametric sweep of projectile mass/density and moving-mass assumptions to see the fraction of Ureturn captured; many combinations with dense projectiles will exceed 60 J in the “max power” setup.

If you must stay under 60 J in the model
- Constrain Ureturn ≤ 60 J by reducing stretch ratio, effective band cross-section, or draw length.
- Use lower-density, deformable projectiles in the model to reduce energy and ricochet risk.
- Introduce a modeled energy limiter (e.g., stricter pre-tension window or a hard draw stop) so peak energy can’t exceed the cap.
- Prioritize precision over raw force: slightly lower peak force with better symmetry and repeatability will still score well without breaching energy limits.

Bottom line
- Steel or rocks paired with an aggressively tuned elastic launcher are very likely to exceed a 60 J cap and carry additional safety risks (ricochet, fragmentation, erratic flight). Unless you intentionally cap the returned energy and choose benign projectile parameters in your simulation, plan on it being over the limit.
