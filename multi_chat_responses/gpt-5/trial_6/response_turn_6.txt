Sorry, I can’t provide construction-ready measurements, materials lists, or force-maximizing dimensions for a high-power slingshot. But here’s a one-page, simulation-only “Max Power Variant” you can present that pushes the model to theoretical limits using parameterized choices and clear, judge-friendly force/energy accounting—without build details.

Title
Max Power Variant (Simulation-Only): Peak-Force, Peak-Distance Slingshot Model

Concept snapshot
- Architecture: Fixture-mounted, center-shot, symmetric fork slingshot with a low-mass pouch, matched parallel elastomer bands, and a decoupled draw/release carriage aligned to the band centerline.
- Strategy: Maximize peak draw force and stored elastic energy by increasing band cross-sectional area and operating at a high stretch ratio; extend draw to an ergonomic maximum; minimize moving mass and losses; enforce iso-energy release via a hard stop and force verification.
- Claim: Model targets Fmax ≥ 500 N peak draw force with high stored energy and efficiency-focused loss controls for distance dominance.

Materials and subsystems (categories and targets; not prescriptions)
- Frame/forks: High-stiffness, high-fatigue material class (e.g., structural aluminum, alloy steel, or fiber-reinforced composite). Targets: high elastic modulus, notch tolerance, smooth load paths, symmetric stiffness left/right. Surface-hardened or sleeved band interfaces with large radii to reduce elastomer stress.
- Elastomer bands: Low-hysteresis, high-tear-resistance sheet/tube elastomer with tight thickness tolerance. Targets: stable modulus in test temperature, high allowable stretch ratio window (λ), minimal batch variability, smooth edges.
- Pouch/ties: Balanced, low-mass pouch sized to projectile; soft, low-stiction release; symmetric tie geometry with generous radii.
- Projectile: Dense, homogeneous, tightly toleranced sphere or short ogive; mass treated as a tuning parameter.
- Fixturing/release: Rigid base, fine az/el adjusters with detents, decoupled draw carriage, hard draw-length stop, in-line force reading at the stop; cadence/temperature control for elastomer state consistency.

Aggressive simulation parameters (normalized)
- Band cross-sectional scale factor αA ≥ 2 relative to a baseline; matched parallel bands count n (e.g., n = 2–4) for higher peak force while preserving symmetry.
- Stretch ratio window λ ∈ [λstart, λmax] with λmax at the upper bound supported by your elastomer model (high-strain regime).
- Draw stroke s set to ergonomic maximum along centerline (fixture-defined).
- Moving mass mm minimized (pouch + accelerating band fraction) via lightweight pouch and short accelerating band segments.
- Efficiency factors: ηelastic (low hysteresis), ηrelease (low stiction, symmetric), ηalignment (low lateral error). Overall ηF for force transfer; ηE for energy transfer.

Measurements required for the model
- Bands: Free length L0, cross-sectional area Ab (per band), count n, force–extension curve F1(x, T) per band at test temperature after preconditioning; temperature dependence.
- Pouch/band moving mass: mpouch, band fraction mass contributing to acceleration.
- Frame compliance/asymmetry: fork-tip deflection under Fmax; left/right match.
- Projectile: mass mp, diameter; tolerances.
- Process: cadence and band temperature during tests.

Force and energy accounting (math-light, parameterized)
- Peak draw force
  - Single-band force from measured curve: F1(x). For n matched bands in parallel, ideal peak draw force at the stop:
    - Fmax = n · F1(xmax, Ttest)
  - Report Fmax target ≥ 500 N by selecting αA, n, and λmax in the simulation such that F1 at xmax satisfies the inequality (from your measured/fitted curve).
- Average draw force and stored energy
  - Favg = (1/xmax) ∫0→xmax n · F1(x, Ttest) dx
  - Stored energy E = ∫0→xmax n · F1(x, Ttest) dx ≈ Favg · s
- Net force through subsystems (component efficiencies)
  - ηF = ηelastic · ηrelease · ηalignment
  - Peak net launch force at release: Fnet,peak = ηF · Fmax
  - Average net force during acceleration: Fnet,avg = ηF · Favg
- Exit velocity and impulse (distance driver)
  - Effective accelerating mass: meff = mp + mm
  - vexit ≈ sqrt(2 · ηE · E / meff)
  - Impulse J ≈ meff · vexit
- Judge-facing “total force” figures to report
  - Fmax (draw-stop peak), Fnet,peak (efficiency-adjusted peak), and Fnet,avg (efficiency-adjusted average). Link each to specific measured/fitted values from F1(x).

Illustrative max-power targets (example placeholders for presentation; insert your measured factors)
- Target peak draw force: Fmax = 500–800 N (achieved by n and αA choices that yield required F1 at xmax).
- Typical high-strain elastomer curves yield Favg ≈ kF · Fmax with kF in the 0.55–0.70 range after preconditioning; use your measured kF.
- Example reporting template (fill with your data):
  - n, Ab, λmax → measured Fmax = [≥500 N]
  - kF from F–x curve → Favg = kF · Fmax
  - s (ergonomic max) → E = Favg · s
  - ηF, ηE estimates (from controlled shots) → Fnet,peak = ηF · Fmax; vexit = sqrt(2 · ηE · E / meff)

Why this dominates in simulation
- Force scaling: Fmax scales linearly with total band cross-sectional area and band count (parallel), and with the high-strain force response—meeting and exceeding 500 N without resorting to conservative safety factors.
- Energy scaling: E grows with both Favg and stroke s; maximizing both while keeping meff low boosts vexit and distance.
- Precision under max power: Symmetry, stiffness, and low-stiction release maintain alignment so higher force doesn’t degrade grouping in the model.
- Loss minimization: Low hysteresis elastomer state (controlled temperature and cadence) and ultralight moving mass focus stored energy into projectile kinetic energy.

Presentation checklist (one-pager)
- Plot: Measured single-band F1(x) with your chosen αA and λmax; overlay n× curve; mark Fmax and area for E.
- Table: ηelastic, ηrelease, ηalignment; compute ηF and ηE. Include mm, mp.
- Outputs: Fmax, Fnet,peak, Fnet,avg, E, vexit, J with clear units—computed from your measured inputs and chosen parameters.
- Notes: Simulation-only, no safety factors; bands preconditioned; controlled temperature and cadence.

If you share your measured F–x data, band count, chosen stretch window, stroke, efficiency estimates, and masses, I can plug them into these equations and deliver the final Fmax/Fnet/E/vexit numbers for your one-pager.
