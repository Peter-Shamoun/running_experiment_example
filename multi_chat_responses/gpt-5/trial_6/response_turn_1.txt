Concept name
Counter-Rotating Flywheel Iso‑Energy Rail Sling (CoFIRS)

Core subsystems
- Human power input: Pedal or hand‑crank module with one‑way clutches to spin up the system smoothly without back‑drive to the user.
- Energy storage: Two equal, shrouded flywheels spinning in opposite directions to cancel gyroscopic and reaction torques.
- Energy metering and release: A governor/indexed clutch that engages only at a preset rotational speed, delivering the same stored energy shot‑to‑shot and removing operator timing variability.
- Energy transfer stage: A short, rigid linear rail with a low‑friction shuttle/sabot that cradles the projectile; a cam/belt linkage shapes the acceleration profile for efficient transfer and gentle release.
- Aiming and alignment: Azimuth/elevation frame with fine worm‑gear adjusters and hard detents, plus a fixed mechanical sight or alignment jig for repeatable setup.
- Safety and control: Full enclosures around moving parts, redundant mechanical brake, interlocks that prevent release unless shields are closed, and a downrange catch/stop compatible with the contest’s safety rules.

Why it excels in contest scoring
- Repeatability: The iso‑energy release (RPM‑indexed) and hard‑indexed aim settings produce highly consistent muzzle energy and launch angle, boosting precision and repeatability metrics.
- Efficiency: Human work is buffered in flywheels, then transferred with a shaped force profile along a guided rail, minimizing off‑axis losses, projectile deformation, and timing errors.
- Stability: Counter‑rotating flywheels cancel net torque on the frame at launch, reducing aim disturbance and improving grouping.
- Modularity: Swappable rail inserts/sabots let you tune for different projectile sizes/masses within the same platform without re‑engineering the whole device.

Key tradeoffs to present
- Complexity vs. reliability: Governors, clutches, and dual flywheels improve performance but add mechanisms that must be robust and well‑toleranced.
- Mass and footprint: Heavier flywheels and shrouds improve energy density and safety but increase setup effort and transport challenges.
- Spin‑up time vs. throughput: Higher stored energy requires longer pedaling/cranking; great for distance shots, slower for rapid‑fire trials.
- Projectile sensitivity: The cam/rail profile that’s optimal for one mass/shape may be suboptimal for another; modular sabots help but add changeover time.
- Compliance constraints: Must clearly demonstrate all energy is human‑supplied, with visible indicators and lockouts to satisfy rules and judges’ safety expectations.

Note: Keep the concept strictly within supervised, rule‑compliant testing, with conservative safety factors and redundant guards/interlocks for any rotating or kinetic subsystem.
