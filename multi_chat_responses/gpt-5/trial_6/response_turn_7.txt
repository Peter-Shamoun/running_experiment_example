Short answer
- Rocks: Generally unsafe. Irregular shape and mass cause unpredictable release, yaw, and fork strikes; they can chip/fragment and ricochet unpredictably.
- Steel balls: Dimensionally consistent but high ricochet and penetration risk. Their higher density makes it easier to exceed the 60 J cap for typical slingshot velocities.
- Could they exceed 60 J? Yes, easily, depending on mass and speed. You should assume a strong max‑power setup can push common steel/stone shot over 60 J unless you deliberately limit mass or velocity and verify with measurements.

Why
- Kinetic energy scales as E = 0.5 × m × v^2. For the same launch speed, denser (heavier) projectiles produce more energy; at the same stored energy, heavier projectiles often exit a bit slower but still carry comparable or higher energy.
- Safety risk is dominated by:
  - Ricochet potential (very high for steel on hard backstops)
  - Fragmentation (rocks can shatter; shards are hazardous)
  - Poor fit/asymmetry (rocks) leading to erratic flight, yaw, or fork strikes

60 J thresholds (to gauge compliance)
- Use vlimit = sqrt(2E/m) with E = 60 J and mass m in kg.
  - 3 g (0.003 kg): vlimit ≈ 200 m/s
  - 8 g (0.008 kg): vlimit ≈ 122 m/s
  - 16 g (0.016 kg): vlimit ≈ 86.6 m/s
  - 20 g (0.020 kg): vlimit ≈ 77.5 m/s
  - 30 g (0.030 kg): vlimit ≈ 63.2 m/s
  - 50 g (0.050 kg): vlimit ≈ 49.0 m/s
Interpretation: With heavier steel or stones (16–30 g is common for larger shot), you can breach 60 J at moderate slingshot speeds. Irregular rocks of similar mass pose the same or greater hazard because of unstable flight and fragmentation.

What to do for the contest
- Use only event‑approved, non‑fragmenting, low‑ricochet projectiles with tight mass/size tolerances.
- Verify energy: measure projectile mass and muzzle velocity with a chronograph, then compute E = 0.5 m v^2 and keep a documented buffer below 60 J.
- Avoid hard backstops; use energy‑absorbing traps rated for your measured energies.
- Don’t substitute rocks or steel unless the rules explicitly allow them and you can demonstrate sub‑60 J operation with data.

Bottom line
Rocks are a poor, unsafe choice; steel is safer dimensionally but much higher in ricochet and energy. Either can exceed 60 J depending on mass/speed; treat them as over‑cap risks unless proven otherwise by measurement.
