Great question. “Simple” slingshots are mechanically minimal, but they’re more complex to optimize for distance and precision because elastomers are highly nonlinear and operator‑coupled. Here’s how the design focus shifts compared with a flywheel/rail concept.

What changes most
- Energy storage and metering
  - Flywheel system: Linear, metered energy via RPM index and clutch; low shot‑to‑shot variation.
  - Slingshot: Elastomer bands have nonlinear force–extension, hysteresis, creep, and strong temperature sensitivity. Repeatability hinges on controlling draw length, draw rate, band conditioning, and temperature.
  - Contest strategy: Add a hard draw‑length stop and a simple in‑line force indicator (e.g., a scale readout) to create an “iso‑energy” draw target. Precondition bands with a fixed number of warm‑up cycles and time shots to keep thermal state consistent.

- Human coupling and release
  - Flywheel system: User is decoupled at launch; the clutch governs release.
  - Slingshot: The user is the power source and the release actuator. Micro‑tremor and timing dominate precision.
  - Contest strategy: Use a rigid shooting jig/fixture with fixed anchor point and fork alignment, plus a consistent release interface (e.g., a standardized tab or release aid compliant with rules) to minimize human variability.

- Acceleration path and projectile guidance
  - Flywheel/rail: Guided shuttle shapes acceleration and exit conditions.
  - Slingshot: Free‑flight from a pouch; any asymmetry (band length/tension, pouch grip, projectile fit) imparts yaw or spin.
  - Contest strategy: Center‑shot geometry, symmetric band routing, and a balanced pouch sized to the projectile improve consistency. A simple short guide channel at the fork (if rules allow) can tame initial yaw without turning it into a “railgun.”

- Aiming and alignment
  - Flywheel/rail: Heavy, stable base with worm‑gear adjusters and detents.
  - Slingshot: Light frame; aim shifts with band tension, grip torque, and fork deflection.
  - Contest strategy: Mount the slingshot in a massy base with azimuth/elevation micrometers and hard detents. Use a repeatable anchor reference and bubble/laser alignment to the target line.

- Structural design emphasis
  - Flywheel/rail: Frame sized for torque reactions and linear launch loads; stiffness drives grouping.
  - Slingshot: Forks sized for combined bending and tension from peak band load; stiffness and symmetry matter more than ultimate strength for precision.
  - Contest strategy: Favor a high‑stiffness frame (closed sections, short fork span) to minimize differential deflection between forks under load. Keep mass concentrated in the base to resist aim disturbance at release.

- Efficiency and throughput
  - Flywheel/rail: Higher mechanical efficiency per shot, but spin‑up time affects cadence.
  - Slingshot: Elastomer losses (hysteresis/heat) reduce efficiency and drift with usage; cadence heats bands and changes behavior.
  - Contest strategy: Define a fixed cadence and rest period to stabilize elastomer temperature; log shot number to anticipate drift.

- Environmental sensitivity
  - Flywheel/rail: Modest sensitivity to ambient conditions.
  - Slingshot: Strong sensitivity to temperature and humidity.
  - Contest strategy: Control or record ambient conditions and band temperature; present correction data with your results.

Ergonomics and scaling for a 5'10" user
- Flywheel/rail: Scale crank/pedal positions, control heights, and sightlines to standard anthropometrics; once set, the user’s posture doesn’t affect the shot.
- Slingshot: Ergonomics matter less if you fixture the device. Prioritize a repeatable anchor distance and comfortable loading posture to avoid fatigue‑induced variation during the draw.

Material focus
- Flywheel/rail frame: Metals/composites for rigidity and damping.
- Slingshot frame: High‑stiffness, damage‑tolerant materials for forks and handle (e.g., aluminum or fiber‑reinforced composites) plus abrasion‑resistant band attachment points to prevent nick‑initiated failures. The elastomer itself dominates performance; its viscoelastic properties and quality control are central to analysis rather than the frame’s ultimate strength.

What to highlight in your presentation
- Modeling: Treat bands as nonlinear, temperature‑dependent springs; show how you convert target “iso‑energy” to a specific draw length/force window.
- Repeatability plan: Preconditioning cycles, timed cadence, draw stops, force indicators, and fixtured release.
- Metrology: Force–draw curves, fork deflection under load, and group size vs. environmental conditions.
- Tradeoffs: Max range vs. repeatability; band durability vs. efficiency; fixture complexity vs. portability.

Bottom line
- The flywheel/rail concept wins on controllability and repeatability via mechanical metering.
- A slingshot demands process control (conditioning, measurement, fixturing) to reach similar precision, because the “spring” and the human are directly in the loop. Keep your design changes focused on decoupling the operator, stabilizing the elastomer’s state, and enforcing symmetry.
