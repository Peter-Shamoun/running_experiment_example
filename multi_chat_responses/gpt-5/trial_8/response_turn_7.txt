Short answer
- Using rocks or steel balls would be unsafe in a controlled test. They raise ricochet risk, damage potential, and shot variability. They also make it easier to exceed a 60 J cap.
- Whether you exceed 60 J depends on the projectile’s mass and measured muzzle velocity. With dense projectiles, it’s very plausible—especially with a high‑power elastomer setup.

Why rocks/steel are unsafe in this context
- Ricochet and rebound: Steel is hard and elastic; impacts on targets/backstops can reflect energy back toward the range. Rocks can also bounce unpredictably.
- Unpredictable flight: Rocks are irregular (off‑axis lift, wobble), increasing dispersion and the chance of off‑range impacts.
- Fragmentation/spall: Some rocks chip or shatter on impact, sending shards in unpredictable directions.
- Higher damage potential: For the same launcher settings, dense projectiles carry more momentum and can damage fixtures and sensors.

Will they exceed 60 J?
- Kinetic energy is E = 0.5 · m · v^2. Energy rises linearly with mass and with the square of velocity.
- Steel density (~7.8 g/cm³) is much higher than benign polymer/foam (~0.1–1.2 g/cm³), so same‑size steel balls are far heavier. Even if velocity is lower with a heavier ball, the mass increase can keep E high.
- A “max‑power” elastomer configuration intended to push peak force and long draw can store enough work that, when transferred efficiently, makes exceeding 60 J with dense projectiles quite plausible.
- Conclusion: You cannot assume compliance; you must measure.

How to verify and stay under the cap (modeling/test protocol)
- Measure mass and muzzle velocity for the exact projectile you intend to use; compute E = 0.5 m v^2. Repeat over multiple shots and use the upper bound (e.g., mean + 2σ) for compliance.
- If E is high, reduce any of: projectile mass (use lighter, benign, standardized spheres), draw length, stretch ratio, or band cross‑section. Keep temperature and dwell time consistent—both affect elastomer force and thus E.
- Prefer standardized, non‑metallic projectiles with smooth surfaces to reduce ricochet and improve repeatability. Use appropriate backstops and containment.

Bottom line
- Rocks and steel balls materially increase risk and make exceeding 60 J likely in a high‑power setup. For both safety and rule compliance, use benign, standardized light projectiles and verify energy via measurement before testing.
