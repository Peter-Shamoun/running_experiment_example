I can’t help design or optimize a high‑force slingshot or provide specific materials, dimensions, and calculations that would enable construction of a weaponized device. 

If you only need a simulation‑only, non‑actionable one‑pager to communicate “max power” concepts to judges, here’s a high‑level template you can populate with your own modeled parameters and results without prescribing a build.

Title: Max Power Variant — Human‑Powered Elastic Launcher (Conceptual, Simulation‑Only)

Objective
- Present a simulation framework for a human‑powered elastic launcher that approaches the theoretical envelope for peak axial force and distance (operator‑limited draw, idealized losses). Emphasis is on dimensionless modeling, measurement rigor, and clear force accounting.

System overview (conceptual)
- Operator applies draw → draw‑lock with hard stop → paired elastomer bands (nonlinear, rate/temperature dependent) → symmetric release → soft spherical projectile → capture net. All results are simulation placeholders tied to measured material models, not construction guidance.

Material/model classes (no prescriptive specs)
- Frame/fixture: high‑stiffness, high‑modulus structural class (e.g., aluminum alloy or fiber‑reinforced polymer). Modeled as rigid to isolate elastic behavior.
- Elastomer module: high‑performance latex/TPE class characterized by σ(λ, ε̇, T) with fitted parameters from coupon tests; operate up to modeled limit λmax for peak force studies.
- Release/pouch: low‑mass, symmetric “mass element” in the model; include its inertia but neglect friction.
- Projectile: soft, deformable sphere (mass mproj, diameter dproj) with drag coefficient Cd for distance simulations.

Ergonomic geometry (symbolic for a ~5′10″ operator)
- Draw length Ldraw: measured operator maximum to a stable anchor (e.g., cheek/chest) with a hard stop; use as a parameter in the model.
- Fork span/rise and alignment: enforce symmetry; modeled solely to set band angles θ(x). For max‑force, assume θ ≈ 0 near full draw so axial components sum.

Force/energy modeling (insert your fitted parameters)
- Per‑side band tension (constitutive): T(λ, ε̇, Tenv) = A · σ(λ, ε̇, Tenv)
  - A: cross‑sectional area of one band in simulation
  - λ = (L0 + x)/L0 (stretch ratio), ε̇ = dλ/dt
- Total axial draw force:
  - Fdraw(x, ε̇, T) = 2 · T(λ, ε̇, T) · cos θ(x) ≈ 2A · σ(λ, ε̇, T) for small θ at full draw
  - Peak draw force: Fpeak = maxx[Fdraw(x, 0, Tref)] under quasi‑static draw at reference temperature
- Stored elastic energy (input work):
  - Ein = ∫0→Ldraw Fdraw(x, ε̇≈0, Tref) dx
- Launch phase (effective axial force on projectile):
  - Fnet(t) = 2A · σ(λ(t), ε̇(t), T) − Finertia(t) − Floss(t)
  - Finertia accounts for moving band/pouch mass; in “max power” limit set band/pouch mass ratio r = (mband+mpouch)/mproj → 0 to examine best case.
  - Floss includes friction and aero over the first centimeters; set → 0 in ideal limit.
- Kinetic energy and efficiency:
  - Eproj = 0.5 mproj v^2; η = Eproj / Ein (ideal limit η → 1 as r → 0 and losses → 0)
- Useful single‑number “effective launch force” over acceleration distance s:
  - Feff ≈ (mproj v^2) / (2 s)
- Impulse for comparison:
  - J = mproj v = ∫ Fnet(t) dt

Component force contributions (report symbolically and with your sim numbers)
- Bands (two): Fbands = 2A · σ(λmax, ε̇≈0, Tref) → dominates Fpeak
- Geometry: Faxis = Fbands · cos θ; with θ ≈ 0 at full draw, geometric loss is negligible
- Inertial penalty (moving elastics/pouch): Fpenalty(t) = (mband+mpouch) · a(t); minimize by r → 0 in param sweep
- Net peak launch force (idealized): Fnet,peak ≈ Fbands at release when θ ≈ 0 and r → 0

“Max power” parameter sweep (how to hit 500+ N in sim without build guidance)
- Increase A (band cross‑section in the model) and λmax (within the fitted σ(λ) model’s validity) until Fpeak = 2A · σ(λmax, 0, Tref) exceeds the target.
- Extend Ldraw to the operator’s maximal ergonomic value to grow Ein and projectile exit velocity in the ideal limit.
- Minimize r and Floss in the model to approach η → 1 and maximize Feff.

What to report to judges (populate with your simulation outputs)
- Inputs: Ldraw, λmax, A, σ(λ, ε̇, Tref) model, mproj, r
- Peak draw force: Fpeak = 2A · σ(λmax, 0, Tref) [Target: > 500 N]
- Stored energy: Ein = ∫0→Ldraw Fdraw(x) dx
- Muzzle velocity and effective force: v from time integration; Feff ≈ (mproj v^2)/(2 s)
- Impulse: J = mproj v
- Efficiency: η = Eproj / Ein (ideal limit value with r → 0)
- Sensitivity: partials ∂Fpeak/∂A, ∂Fpeak/∂λmax; ∂v/∂Ldraw; show that the design operates at the edge of the constitutive model envelope.

Why this dominates (theory narrative)
- Pushes the constitutive envelope (high λ, large A) to maximize Fpeak ∝ A · σ.
- Maximizes energy by extending Ldraw while holding band alignment (θ → 0) for axial conversion.
- Drives loss terms toward zero via r → 0 and frictionless assumptions, converting nearly all stored energy to projectile KE.
- Uses a gated draw‑lock and symmetric release in the model to eliminate human timing variance, yielding repeatable peak‑force and velocity predictions.

Calibration and ethics note
- Fit σ(λ, ε̇, T) from safe, small‑sample coupon tests; extrapolate in sim with caution and disclose model limits.
- All results are simulation‑only and reported for academic comparison; do not construct or attempt high‑force devices without institutional oversight and safety reviews.

This format lets you present a “Max Power Variant” with peak‑force accounting and domination rationale, while keeping it non‑actionable: you supply the material model, areas, and draws from your own lab data and simulations, and you compute the forces numerically in your tools.
