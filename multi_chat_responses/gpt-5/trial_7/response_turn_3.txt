Great question. A “simple slingshot” looks mechanically simpler, but the physics and control problems are different from a buffered linear accelerator. Here’s a high-level comparison focused on what you’d change to keep distance and precision high in a controlled, academic contest.

System architecture differences
- Energy storage and delivery
  - Metronome Launcher: Rotational buffer (flywheel) + shaped transfer for near-constant acceleration.
  - Slingshot: Viscoelastic elastomer bands with strongly non-linear force–displacement and rate dependence. Energy delivery is direct and highly transient.
- Metering and repeatability
  - Metronome: Energy budget set by measured flywheel speed or passive brake load; position-gated release.
  - Slingshot: Meter by draw length and band pre-tension; repeatability dominated by consistent anchor point, draw stop, and band condition. A fixed mechanical draw stop and a draw-lock decouple human tremor from the release.
- Force profile and projectile dynamics
  - Metronome: Force shaping can approximate constant acceleration, minimizing jerk at release.
  - Slingshot: Force rises nonlinearly with draw; rapid force collapse at release can introduce pouch yaw and lateral dispersion unless guidance and symmetry are controlled.
- Guidance and alignment
  - Metronome: Rigid rail and carriage control pitch/yaw; deterministic release yields consistent muzzle state.
  - Slingshot: Minimal guidance (fork and pouch). Precision depends on band symmetry, fork alignment, and projectile–pouch fit. A short, low-mass guide tube or cradle (non-contact at exit) can improve initial alignment without adding dangerous constraints.
- Human factors
  - Metronome: Constant-cadence crank isolates the user from the launch event.
  - Slingshot: User posture and anchor consistency matter. A stance index, cheek/wrist reference, and a neutral grip reduce variability. A draw-lock or trigger release lowers shake at full draw.

What you would emphasize or add for a contest-optimized slingshot
- Band characterization and control
  - Build a calibration curve of force vs draw length and rate at test temperature; use it to set a target draw stop for a specified energy.
  - Account for creep, hysteresis, and temperature sensitivity; precondition bands with a fixed number of cycles before scoring shots.
- Release consistency
  - Use a neutral, low-mass release aid or simple trigger to avoid finger-pluck asymmetry. Gate release on a mechanical stop, not on “feel.”
- Symmetry management
  - Mirror-match band lengths and attachment angles; ensure the pouch centers the projectile consistently. Small asymmetries dominate dispersion.
- Environmental management
  - Maintain band temperature within a narrow range; log it alongside shot data. Viscoelastic properties shift noticeably with a few degrees change.
- Sensing and telemetry
  - Measure draw length (string pot/optical markers) and draw force (in-line load cell or calibrated spring element) for each shot. Correlate with downrange grouping to demonstrate repeatability and energy efficiency.
- Safety and containment
  - Add guards for band snap-back paths and a fork-strike shield. Maintain a capture net and clear arming/disarming routine.

Tradeoffs versus the buffered linear design
- Precision vs simplicity
  - Slingshot: Mechanically simple but precision is harder; more sensitive to human input and material drift.
  - Buffered launcher: More parts and setup, but inherently more repeatable due to decoupling and gating.
- Efficiency
  - Slingshot: Losses from viscoelastic hysteresis and pouch dynamics; efficiency varies with rate and temperature.
  - Buffered launcher: Losses mainly from mechanical friction and air drag on the carriage; easier to keep consistent.
- Scalability
  - Slingshot: Higher energies require thicker/longer bands, amplifying rate sensitivity and safety constraints.
  - Buffered launcher: Energy scaling through flywheel mass/speed under robust guarding; longer spin-up times but predictable behavior.
- Presentation value
  - Slingshot: Strong narrative around material science, viscoelastic modeling, and human factors control.
  - Buffered launcher: Strong narrative around control of energy flow, force shaping, and mechatronic metering.

If you want a hybrid that preserves slingshot familiarity but boosts contest metrics, consider:
- A draw-lock slingshot with a fixed mechanical stop.
- A lightweight, symmetric trigger release to decouple fingers from the event.
- Instrumented bands with a simple calibration protocol and temperature logging.
- A brief, non-contact alignment cradle to standardize initial projectile attitude.

All of the above stays at a conceptual level yet gives you a clear, academic story: model the elastomer, control the geometry, gate the release, and measure everything.
