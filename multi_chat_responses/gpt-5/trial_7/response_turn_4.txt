Below is a modeling-first “spec pack” for a contest-optimized, simple slingshot, emphasizing safe, repeatable operation, energy efficiency, and precision. Values are given as nominal targets with ranges so you can explore trade spaces without committing to a single build. No assembly steps—just what to model and why.

1) Frame and Ergonomics (for ~5'10"/178 cm operator)
- Geometry (nominal; adjust ±10–15% in studies)
  - Fork inner spacing: 65–80 mm (limits fork-strike risk for 25–35 mm projectiles; supports symmetric band paths)
  - Fork rise above grip: 90–120 mm (clear line-of-fire over hand while keeping moment arm manageable)
  - Handle length: 120–140 mm; grip cross-section sized for 75–85 mm hand breadth
  - Draw reference to anchor: 650–750 mm draw length to a cheek/chin anchor with a draw-lock stop (reduces tremor at full draw)
- Material options and key properties (choose one for modeling)
  - 6061‑T6 aluminum: E ≈ 69 GPa, yield ≈ 270 MPa, density ≈ 2.7 g/cc; excellent stiffness/weight, predictable fatigue
  - Glass-filled nylon (PA6/PA12, 30–40% GF): E ≈ 5–10 GPa, yield ≈ 80–140 MPa, density ≈ 1.3–1.5 g/cc; good damping, printable/moldable
  - Laminated birch or ash (with fiber orientations balanced): E ≈ 9–13 GPa along grain, density ≈ 0.65–0.75 g/cc; high toughness, cost-effective
- Stress and stiffness rationale (math-light)
  - Model peak draw force in the 150–250 N range (contest-safe, human-achievable). That load splits through the tines; primary frame demand is bending at the fork roots.
  - Target a safety factor ≥3 on fork-root bending stress at peak draw. For metals, this typically means maintaining section modulus such that elastic deflection at the fork tips stays small (keeps band alignment consistent shot-to-shot).
  - Keep lateral torsional stiffness high (closed or ribbed fork cross-sections) to resist yaw under asymmetric band loads, a key source of dispersion.
  - Ergonomics: include a firm index for wrist angle and a cheek/face anchor reference; the draw-lock/stop should take the load, not the user, for precision.

2) Bands (elastomer selection and geometry)
- Material: natural latex flat bands (fitness/archery-grade). Latex has non-linear, rate- and temperature-dependent behavior; precondition with cycles in testing.
- Geometry (per side; nominal starting point)
  - Thickness: 0.6–1.0 mm
  - Width: 20–25 mm at fork, tapered to 12–16 mm at pouch (taper lowers moving mass and improves efficiency)
  - Relaxed active length: 180–240 mm, pre-tensioned by 5–10% at brace
  - Working stretch ratio (stretched length / relaxed): 4.0–5.0× (stay conservative for longevity and repeatability)
- Performance/limits to model
  - Peak engineering stress: keep below ~1/3–1/2 of latex ultimate (latex UTS ~20–30 MPa typical), factoring rate and temperature, to enhance life and consistency.
  - Hysteresis and temperature: expect efficiency and force to drift with 2–3°C; log band temperature and precycle 30–50 shots before scored runs.
  - Symmetry: match band length/width within ≤1 mm and ≤0.5 mm respectively; small asymmetries dominate dispersion.

3) Pouch and Release
- Pouch
  - Material: thin microfiber/suede or laminated lightweight fabric; target mass 1–2 g
  - Size: 50–60 mm long, 18–25 mm wide at center, gently cupped, with perforations to grip the projectile consistently
  - Rationale: low moving mass and symmetric geometry reduce lateral kick and energy loss; consistent projectile seating improves initial attitude
- Release interface
  - Use a light, symmetric trigger or release aid integrated with a draw-lock. Gate release on the mechanical stop to decouple human tremor and timing.
  - Rationale: reduces “finger pluck” asymmetry and improves shot-to-shot timing, a major contributor to precision.

4) Projectile (soft, contest-safe, distance-oriented)
- Preferred profile for range and safety: soft elastomer or foam-coated sphere, diameter 28–34 mm, mass 20–35 g
  - Example modeling setpoints: 25 g at 30 mm; 30 g at 32 mm
- Aerodynamics and fit
  - Spherical Cd ≈ 0.45–0.5 at relevant Reynolds numbers; surface texture can modestly reduce Cd but keep it soft for safety.
  - Ensure tight, centered seating in the pouch without deformation; oversized or undersized fit introduces yaw.
- Rationale
  - Mass balances exit speed vs. drag (ballistic coefficient). In typical slingshot speed regimes, 20–35 g soft spheres provide good distance without elevating hazard.

5) Measurement and Telemetry (for energy accounting and repeatability)
- Draw length: string potentiometer or optical encoder on the draw-lock sled; resolution ≈ 1 mm
- Draw force: inline compact load cell at the draw-lock; range 0–300 N; sampling ≥100 Hz
- Band temperature: small thermistor or IR sensor aimed at the bands; log ±0.5°C
- Muzzle velocity: optical chronograph gates 0.3–0.5 m downrange, or short photogate window aligned with the projectile path
- Data logging: simple microcontroller with synchronized time-stamping; derive input energy by integrating force over draw; compute efficiency by comparing to projectile kinetic energy
- Rationale: You validate repeatability, efficiency, and environmental control—key judging metrics—without altering the simple mechanics.

6) Energy, Efficiency, and Precision Levers (what to tune)
- Energy storage
  - Increase by longer draw (within ergonomic range) and higher stretch ratio; taper bands to keep moving mass low so more stored energy goes into the projectile.
- Efficiency
  - Minimize moving mass (light pouch, tapered bands), maintain band temperature, and use a smooth, non-yanking release.
  - Expect 45–70% mechanical-to-projectile energy efficiency for well-tuned latex systems; higher with excellent symmetry and low band mass.
- Precision
  - Draw-lock with a hard stop sets consistent energy. Symmetric bands, aligned forks, and a centered pouch reduce lateral dispersion.
  - Rigid frame with high torsional stiffness around the fork plane reduces shot-to-shot yaw from micro asymmetries.
  - Environmental control (temperature) and preconditioning stabilize viscoelastic behavior.

7) Safety and Containment (for controlled testing)
- Full fork-face shield to intercept band/pouch snap-back
- Downrange capture net and clearly defined safe firing envelope
- Positive arming/disarming: a safe de-tension path for bands when not firing
- Routine band inspection and replacement interval based on cycles and measured drift

Nominal modeling summary (one practical baseline to simulate)
- Frame: 6061‑T6, fork spacing 72 mm, rise 105 mm, handle 130 mm; target SF ≥3 at 220 N peak draw
- Bands (per side): 0.75 mm thick, 22→14 mm taper, relaxed length 210 mm, 5% pre-tension, stretch to 4.5× at full draw
- Pouch: microfiber, 1.5 g, 55×20 mm, light cupping, symmetric holes
- Projectile: soft elastomer sphere, 30 mm, 28 g
- Sensing: 0–300 N load cell, 1 mm draw encoder, thermistor on band, optical chrono at 0.4 m

Why this package scores well
- Distance: Good energy storage and low moving mass deliver high exit speeds; projectile mass balances drag for range.
- Precision: Draw-lock, symmetric tapered bands, stiff frame, and controlled release minimize shot-to-shot variation.
- Efficiency and presentation: Instrumented force–draw and velocity data let you quantify input energy, muzzle energy, and repeatability with minimal math—ideal for judges focused on engineering rigor.

Use these as tunable parameters for your optimization runs, then select final setpoints based on your contest’s exact scoring and safety rules.
