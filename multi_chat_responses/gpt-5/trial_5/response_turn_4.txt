Thanks for keeping this squarely in a theoretical, instrumented testbed context. Below is a high-level, modeling-oriented blueprint for a bench-mounted “data-metered elastomer launcher” based on slingshot principles. It focuses on parameter envelopes and scaling rules rather than build steps, aiming at distance and precision while emphasizing safety, measurement, and repeatability.

System overview
- Architecture: Rigid, bench-mounted symmetric fork; elastomer bands; low-mass symmetric pouch with mechanical release; standardized inert projectile; integrated sensing for draw, force, temperature, and exit kinematics. No handheld operation.

1) Structural frame and fork
- Geometry (scaling rules)
  - Fork span: 3–5 projectile diameters to minimize fork strikes while keeping band alignment symmetric.
  - Fork length (from base to band anchor): ~0.3–0.5 of max draw length for stiffness without excess mass.
  - Clearance margins: Keep at least one projectile radius of lateral clearance on each side of the flight path at full draw.
  - Fillets and transitions: Inside radii ≥ 1.5× local thickness at fork roots to reduce stress concentration.
  - Draw stops: Positive hard stops for repeatable draw length; adjustable in small increments.
- Material options (properties for modeling)
  - 6061‑T6 aluminum: E ≈ 69 GPa; yield ≈ 240 MPa; density ≈ 2.7 g/cc; good machinability and toughness.
  - PA6‑GF30 (glass-filled nylon): E ≈ 7–10 GPa; yield ≈ 150–200 MPa; density ≈ 1.35 g/cc; good damping; watch creep.
  - Laminated hardwood/birch ply: E ≈ 10–14 GPa along grain; density ≈ 0.6–0.75 g/cc; add generous section and seal for humidity stability.
- Stress rationale (math-light)
  - Peak fork bending occurs at the root during full draw; treat each limb as a cantilever with tip load equal to half the total band tension.
  - Size the fork section so calculated bending stress stays ≤ 30% of yield under peak draw, with safety factor ≥ 3 to cover shock and material variability.
  - Stiffness targets: Keep tip deflection at full draw ≤ 1–2% of fork span to limit alignment drift; increase section modulus or shorten unsupported length to meet this.
  - Connections: Use broad, radiused band pads to avoid local crushing; avoid sharp pins that notch elastomer.

2) Elastomer bands
- Material and format
  - Natural latex sheet or equivalent high-resilience elastomer with low hysteresis; flat bands favored over tubes for tunable stiffness and better lateral stability.
  - Optional tapered bands (wider at fork, narrower at pouch) to reduce moving mass near the projectile and improve energy transfer.
- Operating envelope
  - Draw ratio: Use a moderate extension region where the force–extension curve remains smooth and repeatable; avoid extreme stretch where hysteresis and drift spike.
  - Pre-tension: Light pre-tension removes slack without entering high-stress regime at rest; enhances shot-to-shot consistency.
  - Temperature sensitivity: Include temperature measurement and compensation; elastomer force can vary appreciably with a few °C.
- Energy and efficiency rationale
  - Stored energy is the area under the force–draw curve; tapering and low-mass pouch shift more of that energy to the projectile rather than band mass.
  - Expect return efficiency < 100% due to internal damping; model efficiency as a function of draw ratio and cycle count (aging).
- Durability
  - Anchor points should spread load; avoid bending the band over tight radii.
  - Track cycle count; re-baseline force–draw curves periodically to account for softening.

3) Pouch and release
- Pouch
  - Material: Tough, flexible fabric/composite or thin leather-like polymer; minimal stretch.
  - Mass target: Keep pouch mass small relative to projectile mass (e.g., pouch mass ≪ projectile mass) to reduce parasitic kinetic energy.
  - Geometry: Symmetric, with centered projectile cradle to minimize yaw and tip-off.
- Mechanical release
  - Use a symmetric sear/trigger that lets both band legs release simultaneously; reduces dispersion relative to finger release.
  - Include an interlock so release only occurs at the set draw stop; improves repeatability and safety.

4) Projectile (standardized, inert)
- Shape
  - Spherical or short round-nosed cylinder to minimize orientation effects; avoid sharp edges.
  - Surface: Smooth, consistent seam to limit asymmetric spin induction.
- Mass and size envelope
  - Choose mass and diameter that are large enough for reliable sensing and stable flight but low in hazard; spherical foam or soft polymer cores are preferred for indoor safety.
  - Fork span and pouch should scale to the chosen diameter per the geometry rules above.
- Aerodynamics and precision rationale
  - Spheres simplify modeling of drag and crosswind effects; use consistent diameter and surface finish for repeatability.
  - Heavier projectiles track straighter through minor disturbances but reduce max distance; lighter ones maximize distance but are more sensitive—pick based on contest scoring weightings.

5) Sensing and metrology
- Draw measurement: Linear encoder or string potentiometer aligned with the band centerline; resolution fine enough to detect sub-millimeter changes in draw length.
- Force measurement: In-line load cell at a fixed anchor or via a calibrated deflection element; sample rate high enough to capture release transients.
- Temperature: Small thermistor or IR sensor aimed at the bands; log with each shot for compensation.
- Release timing symmetry: Dual optical/magnetic sensors on each band leg or high-speed camera to verify simultaneous release.
- Muzzle velocity: Short optical chronograph gate or radar/vision-based measurement at the exit plane; align coaxially to minimize parallax.
- Angle/aim: Goniometer or digital inclinometer on pitch/yaw adjustments; lockable fine-thread screws with hard stops.

6) Alignment and adjustability
- Pitch/yaw micro-adjusters with vernier scales for repeatable aim changes.
- Band alignment guides that keep both legs parallel and co-planar through the draw; reduces lateral bias.
- Replaceable band modules to study stiffness, taper, and aging effects in a controlled way.

7) Precision drivers and how the specs address them
- Release symmetry: Mechanical release and equal band lengths/tension minimize horizontal scatter.
- Frame deflection: Stiff fork and short unsupported lengths reduce dynamic alignment changes at release.
- Band variability: Fixed draw stops, temperature logging, and periodic calibration tighten energy consistency.
- Projectile fit: Pouch geometry that cradles consistently reduces initial yaw; fork span scaled to avoid tip-off from near-strikes.

8) Safety and containment (for the test rig)
- Rigid bench mount, front and side shields, and an enclosed capture/backstop matched to projectile energy.
- Interlocks on release, and a safe “un-draw” procedure via controlled band let-down.
- Energy caps and distance testing only in controlled ranges per contest rules.

How this helps modeling without heavy math
- Treat the frame as a cantilevered fork; keep computed bending stress under a conservative fraction of material yield, with a safety factor for shock.
- Parameterize the elastomer with a measured force–draw curve at a reference temperature, plus a simple temperature coefficient and hysteresis term.
- Use pouch mass and band moving mass as parasitic terms that subtract from projectile energy.
- Characterize dispersion as a function of release symmetry error, frame deflection, and band imbalance; weigh design choices (e.g., fork stiffness, band taper) against these contributors.

This gives you a specification envelope to drive optimization studies—balancing distance, precision, and repeatability—while remaining focused on a benchtop, instrumented, non-handheld rig and inert projectiles for safety.
