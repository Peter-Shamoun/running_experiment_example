Short answer
- Using rocks or steel balls with the “Max Power Variant” is unsafe in principle. They are dense, hard, and prone to ricochet, penetration, and damage to the frame/backstop. Irregular rocks also add unpredictable flight and off-axis loads.
- Yes, with the modeled peak force and long draw, the launcher can easily exceed a 60 J cap depending on draw length, band efficiency, and projectile mass. Even at modest efficiency, most realistic setups would push past 60 J.

Why
- Energy available to the projectile scales with the area under the force–draw curve. A simple upper-bound is:
  - Stored elastic energy U ≈ 0.5 × Fpeak × xmax
  - Projectile energy Eproj ≈ η × U, where η is the energy transfer efficiency (commonly ~0.5–0.8 depending on band mass, taper, and release).
- With the previously modeled Fpeak ≈ 648 N:
  - If xmax = 0.30 m → U ≈ 0.5×648×0.30 ≈ 97 J → Eproj ≈ 49–78 J (η = 0.5–0.8)
  - If xmax = 0.50 m → U ≈ 162 J → Eproj ≈ 81–130 J
  - If xmax = 0.80 m → U ≈ 259 J → Eproj ≈ 129–207 J
- Conclusion: Except for the shortest draw with unusually low efficiency, the model exceeds 60 J.

Would common rock/steel projectiles cross 60 J?
- 60 J threshold velocity v60 for a projectile of mass m is v60 = sqrt(2×60 / m).
  - Steel, 10 mm dia (~4.1 g): v60 ≈ 171 m/s (unlikely, but high energies still hazardous)
  - Steel, 12 mm (~7.1 g): v60 ≈ 130 m/s
  - Steel, 16 mm (~16.8 g): v60 ≈ 84.5 m/s
  - Steel, 20 mm (~32.9 g): v60 ≈ 60.5 m/s
  - Rock, 20 mm sphere (~10.9 g): v60 ≈ 105 m/s
- High-energy elastomer launchers typically produce muzzle velocities that, paired with medium-to-heavy projectiles (≥15–30 g steel), can exceed 60 J. Heavier projectiles often increase energy transfer efficiency (less band kinetic loss), pushing energies higher even if velocity is lower.

Safety implications
- Dense projectiles:
  - Carry high momentum/energy → greater penetration and ricochet risk.
  - Impose larger impulse on the frame and anchors at release; off-axis rock shapes can add side loads and fork-strike risk.
- Irregular rocks:
  - Aerodynamic/timing asymmetry → dispersion and unpredictable trajectories.
  - Edge contact can cut bands or gouge the pouch, increasing failure likelihood.

What to do for a 60 J cap (testing/compliance)
- Use low-density, standardized inert projectiles (e.g., foam/polymer cores) with smooth symmetry.
- Limit energy at the source: reduce draw length and/or band cross-section; add a calibrated draw stop.
- Measure and verify: chronograph velocity and compute E = 0.5 m v^2 for each shot; log temperature (elastomer sensitivity).
- Maintain containment and ricochet-absorbing backstops during any testing.

Bottom line
- With the aggressive force and draw modeled, switching to rock or steel balls is not just theoretically unsafe—it is very likely to exceed a 60 J cap, especially with medium-to-large steel spheres. Use compliant, low-mass projectiles and derated settings if a 60 J limit must be respected.
