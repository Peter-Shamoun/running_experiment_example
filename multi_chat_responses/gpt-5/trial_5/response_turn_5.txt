I can’t provide a detailed, buildable blueprint with exact dimensions and a bill of materials for a high‑force launcher. However, here is a one‑page, high‑level conceptual design and force‑modeling framework you can present to judges. It focuses on theory, material properties, measurement, and how force is generated and accounted for—without construction details.

Title: Conceptual Force‑Optimized, Metered Elastomer Launcher (Bench‑Mounted, Instrumented)

Goal
- Maximize measured output force while preserving precision and repeatability in a controlled, non‑handheld testbed.

System architecture (conceptual)
- Symmetric forked frame on a rigid bench base with fixed draw stop.
- Dual flat elastomer bands with tapered geometry and light pre‑tension.
- Low‑mass, symmetric pouch with a simultaneous mechanical release.
- Standardized inert projectile for kinematic sensing.
- Integrated metrology: draw length, force, temperature, band timing, and muzzle velocity.

Materials and key properties (for modeling)
- Frame/fork: 6061‑T6 aluminum or equivalent structural alloy/composite
  - Representative properties: E ≈ 69 GPa; yield strength ≥ 240 MPa; density ≈ 2.7 g/cc; good fatigue resistance and machinability.
- Elastomer bands: natural latex sheet (high resilience, low hysteresis)
  - Representative properties: tensile strength 20–30 MPa; elongation at break 600–800%; strong temperature dependence; rate‑dependent damping.
- Pouch and release: thin, tough polymer/fabric laminate (low stretch), stainless sear components (wear resistant, low friction).
- Fasteners and anchors: rounded, broad contact surfaces to minimize elastomer stress concentrations.

Geometric scaling and “measurements needed” (dimensionless targets)
- Fork span: 3–5× projectile diameter to reduce fork strikes while maintaining compactness.
- Fork root radii: inside radii ≥ 1.5× local thickness to reduce stress concentration.
- Unsupported fork length: ~0.3–0.5× max draw length to increase stiffness and keep tip deflection ≤ 1–2% of span at peak load.
- Band geometry: flat bands with width-to-thickness selected for target stiffness; optional taper (wider at fork, narrower at pouch) to reduce moving mass.
- Draw ratio: λmax = (L0 + xmax)/L0 chosen below the elastomer’s high‑hysteresis regime; practically λmax ≈ 3–4 for many natural latex formulations (to be verified by measurement at test temperature).
- Pre‑tension: light pre‑load removes slack without entering high stress at rest; improves repeatability.
- Release symmetry: equal leg lengths and mirrored attachments; sear designed for simultaneous let‑off.

Stress and stiffness rationale (frame/fork)
- Treat each fork as a cantilever with tip load equal to half the total band tension at full draw.
- Design criterion: peak computed bending stress ≤ ~30% of material yield for a shock‑inclusive safety factor ≥ 3.
- Stiffness target: keep lateral/vertical tip deflections at full draw ≤ 1–2% of span to minimize aim drift; increase section modulus or shorten unsupported length to meet this.

Force model (math‑light, measurement‑anchored)
- Define band cross‑section area per leg: A = b × t (width × thickness).
- Stretch ratio: λ = (L0 + x)/L0, where L0 is band free length and x is draw length.
- Band material law (use measured data for your latex): engineering stress σ(λ, T, v) capturing hyperelastic response plus rate/temperature effects.
  - Practical model for fitting: σ(λ) ≈ c1(λ − 1) + c2(λ2 − 1), corrected by [1 + αT(T − Tref)] and a small viscous term cvisc v, where v is draw speed.
- Per‑leg tension: Tleg(λ) = σ(λ) × A.
- Geometric loss factor: bands form a small angle θ to the aim axis; axial contribution per leg is Tleg cos θ.
- Total axial draw force at the stop (peak static): Fdraw,peak = 2 Tleg(λmax) cos θ.
- Stored elastic energy for flight modeling (if needed): U ≈ ∫0→xmax Fdraw(x) dx; exit performance is governed by U and moving mass, but judges’ “force” metric is typically Fdraw,peak.
- Parasitic terms to account for in a “force budget”:
  - Angle loss: cos θ < 1; minimize with alignment and adequate fork span.
  - Viscoelastic losses: rate and temperature; log T and v to normalize.
  - Release friction: minimize with polished, symmetric sear; verify with timing sensors.

Force optimization levers (conceptual, not prescriptive)
- Increase A (band width and/or thickness) to raise Tleg at a given λ while keeping band stress σ below an allowable fraction of tensile strength (e.g., ≤ 25–30% at λmax for durability and stability).
- Use tapered bands to keep moving mass low while maintaining high root stiffness; higher Tleg with less energy lost to accelerating the bands.
- Select λmax within the material’s efficient region (avoid extreme stretch where hysteresis and drift spike).
- Control temperature: normalize to a reference T; pre‑condition bands to a steady state for consistent σ(λ).
- Maintain near‑zero θ by aligning band centerlines through draw to reduce cos θ losses.

Example calculation structure (symbolic, plug in your measured values)
- Measure σ(λ) at Tref and nominal draw speed; fit c1, c2 (and αT, cvisc if desired).
- Choose A based on allowable stress σallow = f × σult (e.g., f ≈ 0.25–0.3) at λmax.
- Compute Tleg(λmax) = σ(λmax) × A.
- Estimate θ at full draw from geometry; cos θ ≈ 0.98–1.00 if well aligned.
- Total peak force: Fdraw,peak = 2 × Tleg(λmax) × cos θ.
  - Example form (no numbers): If σ(λmax) = 6 MPa from your test, A = 40 mm2, cos θ = 0.99 → Tleg ≈ 240 N → Fdraw,peak ≈ 2 × 240 × 0.99 ≈ 475 N. Substitute your measured σ and selected A.

Measurement plan (to support the “force produced through each component” narrative)
- Draw length x and angle θ sensors to compute λ and cos θ.
- In‑line load cell on a fixed anchor to record Fdraw(x); this directly validates 2 Tleg cos θ.
- Band thermistor to record T for σ(λ, T) normalization.
- Sear timing sensors to confirm simultaneous release (precision).
- Optional high‑speed or radar/optical gate for muzzle velocity to correlate U with kinematics.

Why this wins on force and precision (rationale)
- Force: Larger A within σallow, operation at an efficient λmax, minimal θ, and low release friction maximize Fdraw,peak.
- Precision: Symmetric layout, rigid frame, fixed draw stop, and environmental compensation minimize shot‑to‑shot variation.
- Documentation: A measured σ(λ) curve, explicit σallow margin, and a clear Fdraw,peak calculation satisfy judges’ “force per component and total” requirement without construction details.

This one‑pager gives you a clear, test‑anchored force model: Fdraw,peak = 2 × σ(λmax, T, v) × A × cos θ, with rationale for choosing materials, geometry, and measurement needed to support and optimize that result.
