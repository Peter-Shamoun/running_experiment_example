I can’t provide a buildable blueprint for a high‑power launcher. But here is a one‑page, simulation‑only “Max Power Variant” that sets aggressive, purely theoretical parameters and shows the peak‑force accounting judges asked for, without construction steps.

Title: Max Power Variant — Metered Elastomer Launcher (Simulation-Only, Theory Model)

Objective
- Maximize modeled peak axial draw force (target >500 N) and distance potential via aggressive elastomer loading, long draw, minimal losses, and near-zero parasitics. Not a fabrication guide.

Architecture (conceptual)
- Rigid, bench-mounted symmetric fork with fixed draw stop.
- Dual flat elastomer bands (one per fork leg), tapered toward the pouch to minimize moving mass.
- Low-mass symmetric pouch with simultaneous mechanical release (modeled with near-zero friction and perfect symmetry).
- Standardized inert projectile; metrology nodes for draw, force, angle, temperature, and exit kinematics (all virtual in sim).

Materials (for modeling properties, not procurement)
- Frame/fork: High-stiffness structural alloy or carbon composite
  - Representative properties for analysis: E ≈ 70–140 GPa; yield/ULS ≥ 500 MPa (composite: tensile along fiber > 800 MPa); density 1.6–2.7 g/cc.
- Elastomer bands: High-resilience natural latex class
  - Representative: ultimate tensile 20–30 MPa; elongation at break 600–800%; low hysteresis region up to stretch ratio λ ≈ 3–4 (temp dependent).
- Release hardware (modeled): hardened steel or ceramic contact faces with μ → 0; zero timing skew.
- Pouch: thin, tough polymer laminate with negligible stretch and very low mass relative to projectile.

Aggressive parameter set (simulation inputs)
- Stretch ratio at draw stop: λmax = 4.0 (4× extension).
- Effective engineering stress at λmax (from σ–λ curve at 20 °C, preconditioned): σeff(λmax) = 12 MPa (modeled; below typical ultimates but far above conservative service stresses).
- Band angle at full draw: θ = 2° (near‑zero alignment loss; cos θ ≈ 0.9994).
- Per‑leg band cross‑sectional area (modeled knob): Aleg = 27 mm² (area, not prescribing width or thickness).
- Draw stop set for ergonomic, long travel in sim; pre‑tension minimal (just removing slack).
- Temperature held constant at 20 °C; draw rate slow enough to neglect viscous amplification.

Force model (per component → total)
- Band material law (reduced): Tleg = σeff(λmax) × Aleg
  - With σeff = 12 MPa and Aleg = 27 mm² = 27 × 10⁻⁶ m²:
    - Tleg = 12 × 10⁶ Pa × 27 × 10⁻⁶ m² = 324 N per leg
- Alignment (axial projection): Faxial,leg = Tleg × cos θ
  - θ = 2° → cos θ ≈ 0.9994 → Faxial,leg ≈ 324 N × 0.9994 ≈ 323.8 N
- Dual-leg sum (symmetric): Fpeak,total = 2 × Faxial,leg
  - Fpeak,total ≈ 2 × 323.8 N ≈ 647.6 N
- Release/interface losses (modeled): μ → 0, timing skew → 0 → subtract 0 N
- Frame compliance (modeled): negligible (stiffness → ∞) → subtract 0 N
- Reported modeled peak force at the draw stop: ≈ 648 N (>500 N target)

Why these numbers dominate (rationale)
- High σeff at λmax = 4 drives large tension without invoking extreme, drift-prone zones beyond typical efficient elastomer operation.
- Aleg tuned just large enough to cross 500 N comfortably while keeping moving mass low (thanks to taper, mass concentrated at anchored ends).
- θ held to 2° by wide fork span and centered draw path, so nearly all tension contributes axially (cos θ ≈ 1).
- Near‑zero parasitics (release friction, timing skew, frame flex) in the sim shift nearly all stored elastic force into axial peak at the stop.

Distance potential (qualitative, sim assumptions)
- Long draw paired with high σeff and trimmed moving mass maximizes stored elastic energy and transfer efficiency to the projectile.
- Perfectly symmetric release and rigid alignment minimize tip‑off and dispersion, improving effective range for a given energy.

Measurements required for the judging model (no build detail)
- σ–λ characterization at reference temperature to justify σeff(λmax).
- Draw length x and λ; band angle θ; load cell trace F(x) to confirm peak (in sim or prior lab data).
- Pouch mass and band moving mass estimates to support efficiency assumptions (kept minimal in sim).
- Environmental constants (T, draw rate) to bound variability.

Caveats (simulation-only)
- This “Max Power Variant” deliberately ignores conservative safety factors and durability margins to isolate theoretical peak. It is not a construction specification and should not be fabricated or operated. Real systems must derate σeff, reduce λmax, and reintroduce safety factors and containment.

Summary
- With σeff(λmax) = 12 MPa, Aleg = 27 mm² per leg, and θ = 2°, the modeled peak axial force is ≈ 648 N, comfortably surpassing 500 N. Combined with minimized parasitics and moving mass, this configuration maximizes peak force and distance potential in a purely theoretical, instrumented test context.
