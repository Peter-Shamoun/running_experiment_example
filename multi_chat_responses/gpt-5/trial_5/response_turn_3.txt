Great question. “Simple” slingshots are mechanically simpler but systemically more complicated because elastomers add variability. Here’s how the design approach diverges from the flywheel/roller launcher at a high level:

- Energy storage and metering
  - Flywheel: Kinetic energy set by speed; a metering clutch delivers a repeatable energy packet.
  - Slingshot: Elastic energy set by draw length/force; variability from temperature, aging, and hysteresis. Use displacement-based metering (hard draw stops) and non-contact sensing to log draw length/force for consistency and post-shot analysis.

- Power transfer and release
  - Flywheel: Controlled, timed engagement to rollers; low sensitivity to human timing.
  - Slingshot: Pouch release dominates dispersion; replace human fingers with a symmetric mechanical release to reduce yaw and timing scatter. Expect more sensitivity to small asymmetries.

- Projectile control
  - Flywheel: Rollers can set spin and exit angle independently.
  - Slingshot: Spin is harder to control; pouch geometry and fork alignment influence initial tip-off. Add rigid guides and precise fork symmetry to tame lateral bias.

- Human input and ergonomics
  - Flywheel: Pedal/hand-crank with low peak effort, decoupled from launch.
  - Slingshot: Peak draw force is high and brief; consider a geared draw-assist and latch to bank effort, improving repeatability and reducing fatigue.

- Structure and loads
  - Flywheel: Rigid base with guards around rotating mass; loads are mostly steady-state plus brief torque transients.
  - Slingshot: Forks see high, rapidly changing tensile loads and shock at release; prioritize fork symmetry, low-creep materials, and generous safety factors for elastomer anchor points. Add snap-back containment.

- Sensing and calibration
  - Flywheel: RPM and clutch settings map directly to shot energy.
  - Slingshot: Track band temperature, draw length/force, and cycle count; re-baseline frequently due to elastomer drift. Build calibration curves for the judging deck rather than relying on nominal specs.

- Efficiency and repeatability
  - Flywheel: Higher repeatability, good efficiency through rigid power paths.
  - Slingshot: More internal damping and aging; expect lower energy return and wider spread unless tightly controlled.

- Safety and containment
  - Flywheel: Guarding for spin hazards and a controlled brake.
  - Slingshot: Guards for snap-back, a robust backstop, and interlocked release to keep hands clear.

- Contest tradeoffs
  - Slingshot upsides: Lightweight, compact, fast to reset, visually intuitive.
  - Downsides: Greater environmental sensitivity, more tuning drift, release-induced dispersion.
  - What stands out to judges: Clear energy metering via fixed draw stops, mechanical release, and data-driven compensation for temperature/aging—framed as a control-and-variability study versus a pure power build.

In short, with slingshots you shift design effort from power transmission to controlling elastomer variability and release symmetry, plus documenting that control for repeatable, judge-friendly performance.
