Great question. A “simple” slingshot is fundamentally different from a flywheel-based launcher in how it stores, meters, and releases energy. Here’s a high-level contrast focused on contest-relevant factors (distance, precision, repeatability) without build details.

Conceptual differences to highlight
- Energy storage and delivery
  - Flywheel design: Linear, time-invariant storage with controllable, metered discharge.
  - Slingshot: Nonlinear elastic storage with rate-, temperature-, and history-dependent behavior (viscoelasticity, hysteresis, creep). Output depends strongly on draw length and release dynamics.
- Human coupling
  - Flywheel: Human input decoupled from launch via inertial buffer → high repeatability.
  - Slingshot: Human is part of the spring system until the instant of release → higher variability unless you use a bench fixture and a standardized release.
- Release mechanics
  - Flywheel: Instrumented, fixed-geometry release point.
  - Slingshot: Pinch releases are variable; mechanical releases improve precision but add their own compliance and timing effects.
- Guidance and acceleration path
  - Flywheel: Long, guided acceleration → controlled projectile attitude.
  - Slingshot: Very short acceleration over the draw distance; small misalignments in pouch or fork can tilt spin/dispersion.
- Control and tunability
  - Flywheel: Adjust torque profile, shuttle mass, guide angle independently.
  - Slingshot: Main knobs are draw length, geometry, and symmetry; changes interact nonlinearly.

Ergonomic scaling for a slingshot-based contest rig
- Treat it as a bench-mounted, adjustable fixture rather than a handheld tool to reduce operator variability.
- Draw length adjustability: Provide a range that spans comfortable reaches for most users (for example, roughly shoulder-to-hand reach with ±15–20% adjustability) and a hard stop for repeatability.
- Anchor height and stance: Set the fork/anchor near mid-chest height for neutral shoulders; include vertical and horizontal adjustments so the operator can maintain a stable stance without shoulder elevation or wrist deviation.
- Aiming: Add fine elevation/azimuth adjustment of the fork plane independent of draw mechanism; include angle scales viewable from the operator position.

Structural and load-path differences (for analysis slides)
- Dominant loads
  - Flywheel system: Bending from reaction torque and short launch pulses in the guide.
  - Slingshot system: Tensile load in the elastic element; symmetric but high concentrated loads at the fork tips; frame sees steady draw force plus a snap load at release.
- Simplified load cases
  - L1: Peak draw force at full extension acting across fork tips, inducing bending in the fork bridge and uprights.
  - L2: Off-axis imbalance (left/right band mismatch) causing a small lateral moment on the fork.
  - L3: Release transient; treat with a dynamic amplification factor relative to L1 to bound joint slip and deflection.
- Basic checks to communicate
  - Fork beam bending: Model the fork bridge as a short beam with two equal end loads. Limit elastic deflection so the fork plane angle change at release is below your precision target (for example, <0.1°).
  - Upright compression/bending: Verify column stability under the resultant of draw force and any offset; keep safety factor ≥2 for yield and ≥3 for buckling.
  - Joint slip margins: Preload fasteners so clamp friction exceeds peak draw by a comfortable factor; use hard inserts where needed to control bearing stress.

Material recommendations (high-level)
- Frame and fork: 6061‑T6 aluminum tubing/plate or modular extrusion for adjustability; good stiffness-to-weight, easy to reconfigure. If compactness dominates, consider thin-wall steel for the fork bridge to contain bending with smaller sections at the cost of mass.
- Interfaces: Use wear-resistant inserts or spreader plates at high-contact points to keep local bearing stresses low and maintain alignment over repeated draws.

Why slingshot-style systems are harder to score well on repeatability
- Elastic variability: Force–extension curves shift with temperature, draw rate, and cycles.
- Release sensitivity: Small asymmetries in pouch orientation or timing add spin and dispersion.
- Short acceleration path: Minor geometric errors translate into larger angular errors at exit.

How to present a contest-strong slingshot concept (without build specifics)
- Emphasize decoupling and measurement: A bench fixture that fixes fork plane, draw length, and release timing; integrate simple sensing for draw length and angle to quantify variability.
- Model vs. data: Show a nonlinear spring model with hysteresis bounds and compare to measured draw curves to justify efficiency estimates.
- Precision strategy: Focus on symmetry and alignment control, minimizing fork deflection, and constraining release angle, rather than chasing maximum stored energy.

Key tradeoffs to note
- Simplicity vs. control: Handheld simplicity sacrifices repeatability; fixturing adds parts but stabilizes results.
- Elastic efficiency vs. consistency: Higher draw and stiffer elements can store more energy but typically amplify sensitivity to misalignment and temperature.
- Mass/stiffness vs. portability: Stiffer forks and frames reduce angular error but increase size/weight; modularity helps balance this.

In short, compared to the flywheel launcher, a slingshot-oriented entry needs more emphasis on controlling nonlinear elastic behavior and release geometry. Structurally it’s dominated by static draw forces and fork bending rather than torque impulses, and ergonomically it benefits from a bench fixture with generous adjustability to achieve precision and repeatability.
