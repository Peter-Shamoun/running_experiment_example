Short answer
- Yes, substituting rock or steel balls would be unsafe and would likely exceed a 60 J cap in the “max power” simulation regime. Hard, dense projectiles carry more momentum, don’t deform on impact, ricochet readily, and have much higher ballistic coefficient (longer range), all of which increase hazard dramatically.

Why they’re unsafe in this context
- Energy transfer: Rigid, non-deforming spheres (steel/stone) absorb and retain a larger share of the delivered energy than compliant foam, so more energy is available to do harm and to travel farther.
- Impact severity: Higher contact stress and much higher momentum at the same energy raise injury and damage risk. Elastic rebounds/ricochet risk is significant on hard surfaces.
- Flight risk: For the same diameter, a steel ball has a far higher mass and ballistic coefficient than foam; it sheds velocity more slowly, extending hazard distance.
- Structural margins: The “max power” variant assumed near-zero safety factors and ideal alignment. Using dense projectiles in that regime removes the benign damping provided by foam and increases consequence of any misalignment or release variability.

Would they exceed 60 J?
- Use the model’s upper-bound energy relation (near-linear draw, high efficiency):
  - Eproj ≈ η · 0.5 · Fpeak · Ldraw
  - To stay at or below 60 J: Ldraw ≤ 2·60 / (η·Fpeak)
- Plugging aggressive but plausible “max power” values:
  - If Fpeak = 600 N and η = 0.9 → Ldraw ≤ 120 / 540 ≈ 0.22 m to stay ≤ 60 J.
  - If Fpeak = 800 N and η = 0.9 → Ldraw ≤ 120 / 720 ≈ 0.17 m.
  - If Fpeak = 500 N and η = 0.8 → Ldraw ≤ 120 / 400 = 0.30 m.
- Conclusion: In the max-power scenario, any draw length beyond a few tenths of a meter pushes Eproj above 60 J. Because projectile material doesn’t change the energy delivered (only how it’s partitioned), a rock/steel ball would carry roughly that full energy and thus exceed the cap under these conditions.

Velocity thresholds for common rigid projectile masses (for intuition)
- The velocity needed to hit 60 J is v60 = sqrt(2·60 / m):
  - 20 g → v60 ≈ 77 m/s
  - 30 g → v60 ≈ 63 m/s
  - 50 g → v60 ≈ 49 m/s
  - 100 g → v60 ≈ 35 m/s
If your modeled Eproj > 60 J, any of these masses would be over the cap regardless of their actual speed; heavier ones will simply travel slower at the same energy but remain just as hazardous.

Bottom line
- Under the “max power” assumptions, the launcher’s delivered energy readily surpasses 60 J for realistic draw lengths, so using rock or steel balls would be both outside the stated safety cap and substantially more dangerous than compliant foam. For a safe, compliant entry and controlled testing, keep to soft foam projectiles and use measured F–x curves to set a draw limit that guarantees Eproj ≤ 60 J.
