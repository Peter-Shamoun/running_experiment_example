Ergonomic scaling for an average adult (≈5'10" or 178 cm)
- User stance and reach
  - Operator stands on a flat platform flush with the base. Plan the crank axis 0.95–1.05 m above the platform, horizontally 0.25–0.35 m in front of the toe line. This keeps shoulder and elbow in neutral ranges for most users and supports steady torque.
  - Provide ±100 mm vertical and ±75 mm horizontal adjustability on the crank mount to accommodate 5th–95th percentile users without changing posture.
- Device envelope for comfort and stability
  - Track length: 1.6–2.0 m (allows gentle acceleration profiles and consistent release geometry).
  - Overall height: 1.2–1.4 m (crank/flywheel shielding within reach, clear sight lines).
  - Base width: 0.8–1.0 m with removable outriggers or floor anchors to resist tipping from crank torque and launch reaction.
  - Aim adjustment: ±10° elevation and ±10° azimuth with fine-thread screws; scales readable from the operator’s position.

Recommended frame material
- Primary choice: 6061‑T6 aluminum (square tube or T‑slot extrusion)
  - Why: High stiffness-to-weight, corrosion resistant, easily machined/bolted, and commonly available in modular profiles for adjustability.
  - Typical properties: E ≈ 69 GPa; yield strength ≈ 240–280 MPa; ultimate ≈ 290–320 MPa; density ≈ 2700 kg/m³. No true endurance limit—use conservative fatigue design.
  - Practical profiles: 40×40×3 mm square tube or 40 mm T‑slot extrusion for uprights and rails; 20–30 mm profiles for secondary bracing and guards.
- Alternative for very compact frames: 4130 steel tubing
  - E ≈ 200 GPa; yield ≈ 400–600 MPa; density ≈ 7850 kg/m³. Allows smaller sections at the cost of mass; better intrinsic damping; weldable but less modular.

Basic stress and stiffness considerations (for analysis slides)
- Simplified load cases to size members
  - L1: Steady human spin‑up torque into flywheel. Use peak input torque at the crank translated through gearing to a reaction torque at the flywheel supports.
  - L2: Short-duration launch pulse into the track/guide supports. Model as a concentrated axial force along the guide plus a transverse reaction from misalignment.
  - L3: Lateral loads from aiming/handling and accidental bumps. Use a nominal 100–200 N side load at ~1.0 m height for stability checks.
  - Apply a dynamic amplification factor of 2.0–3.0 to L2 to account for pulse and joint compliance. Target safety factors: ≥2.0 for static yield, ≥3.0 for buckling, and joint slip reserve ≥1.5 at max preload.

- Example sizing check for 40×40×3 mm 6061‑T6 square tube uprights
  - Section properties (per axis): I ≈ 1.0×10⁻⁷ m⁴; section modulus S ≈ 5.1×10⁻⁶ m³.
  - Flywheel reaction torque: assume a conservative peak T = 200 N·m during transfer; if supported between two uprights, the cross‑member sees a couple and each upright sees a bending moment on the order of M ≈ T.
    - Bending stress: σ = M/S ≈ 200 / (5.1×10⁻⁶) ≈ 39 MPa < 240 MPa yield; SF ≈ 6.
  - Launch force into track supports: assume a design axial F = 1 kN (covers a wide range of light projectiles with comfortable acceleration).
    - Column buckling (upright length L ≈ 1.2 m, pinned‑pinned): Pcr = π² E I / L² ≈ 48 kN >> 1 kN; SF (buckling) > 40.
    - Lateral deflection criterion for precision: if the track length is 2.0 m, keep tip deflection under ~1–2 mm to limit angular change to ≤0.05–0.1°. Add a diagonal brace or a second rail if static analysis shows more than ~1 mm lateral deflection under L2.
  - Joint/bearing checks: ensure fastener clamp loads exceed shear from L2 by ≥1.5×, and bearing stresses in aluminum around bolt holes remain below ~80–100 MPa (use washers/spreaders or steel inserts at high-load interfaces).

- Base stability against tipping (rule-of-thumb)
  - For a side load F at height h, require W·(b/2) ≥ F·h, where W is the system weight and b is the base width. Example: F = 200 N at h = 1.0 m with W = 300 N (≈30 kg) implies b ≥ 1.33 m. If a narrower footprint is desired, add outriggers, sandbags, or floor anchors.

Why this approach supports contest scoring
- Ergonomic consistency reduces operator-induced variability, improving repeatability metrics.
- 6061‑T6 with modular profiles enables rapid tuning of geometry and stiffness, letting you show correlation between model predictions and measured variance.
- Clear, conservative stress/deflection rationale aligns with “safe, controlled” operation and supports a polished engineering presentation.

Key tradeoffs to note
- Aluminum modular frames are slightly heavier/larger than optimized welded steel for the same stiffness but are far more adjustable and easier to document.
- Over‑stiffening improves precision but increases mass and cost; present how you chose stiffness to meet a quantified angular deflection target.
- Wider bases boost stability but reduce portability; anchors or removable outriggers mitigate this.

Implementation notes for adjustability and analysis
- Slot‑and‑clamp joints for crank height and reach; indexed angle plates for aiming.
- Use simple beam and column models for first-pass sizing, then validate with a few FEA snapshots for the judging packet (focus on deflection under L2 and joint slip margins).
- Document safety factors, deflection targets, and ergonomic ranges as tunable parameters rather than fixed numbers to emphasize theoretical optimization.
