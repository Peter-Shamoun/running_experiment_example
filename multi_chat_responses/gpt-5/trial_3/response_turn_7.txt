Short answer: Yes—substituting rock or steel balls would be unsafe and would very likely push the system over a 60 J cap, even if nothing else is changed.

Why hard, dense projectiles are unsafe
- Much higher mass and density: For the same launch speed, kinetic energy scales with mass (E = 0.5·m·v^2). Steel is orders of magnitude denser than foam, so energy and momentum rise sharply.
- Efficiency shift: Elastic launchers often transfer a larger fraction of stored energy to heavier projectiles (less band “rebound” loss), so exit energy can approach the elastic’s stored energy. You can exceed an energy cap without any obvious increase in draw force.
- Impact hazard: Steel/rock have high hardness and low compliance, increasing penetration risk, ricochet potential, and damage to backstops and surroundings.
- Unpredictable behavior: Rocks are irregular and can yaw or fragment; steel spheres can ricochet with little energy loss. Both raise bystander risk.
- Structural/release risk: Heavier projectiles increase momentum, amplifying consequences of any misalignment or release asymmetry (more fork strike/side load risk), and can overstress guides or catches in ways foam cannot.

Would they exceed 60 J?
- It’s plausible to exceed 60 J with common slingshot-like speeds and steel-ball masses. Illustrative bounds:
  - 20 g at 80 m/s → ~64 J
  - 30 g at 65 m/s → ~63 J
  - 50 g at 49 m/s → ~60 J
- Many elastic launchers can send 10–30 g projectiles into the 50–90 m/s range in optimized conditions; combinations in that space cross 60 J easily. Because heavier projectiles can capture a larger share of the stored energy, switching from a light foam ball to a steel or rock projectile can push you over the cap even if velocity drops.

What to do for compliance (and why the contest likely forbids hard projectiles)
- Use only compliant, foam projectiles specified by the rules.
- Verify energy with a chronograph: weigh the projectile, measure exit speed, compute E = 0.5·m·v^2, and document it.
- Set a hard draw stop and stick to elastics and geometries characterized to stay below 60 J with your approved projectile.
- Provide backstops and guards appropriate to the approved projectile class; never swap in denser shot.

Bottom line: Rock or steel balls are not just outside typical contest rules—they materially increase risk and make exceeding a 60 J safety cap very likely.
