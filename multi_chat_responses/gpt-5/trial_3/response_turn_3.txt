Great question. A “simple” slingshot is actually a very different architecture from the gyro/flywheel linear accelerator, so the design emphasis shifts in several ways.

High-level architectural differences
- Human power buffering
  - Flywheel launcher: Buffers human input over seconds (cranks) and releases it in a controlled, millisecond window.
  - Slingshot: Direct human input at the instant of release; little or no buffering. Operator biomechanics dominate consistency.

- Energy storage and force profile
  - Flywheel: Inertial storage with tunable, repeatable energy setpoints (by RPM). Near-constant force transfer can be engineered.
  - Slingshot: Elastomeric storage with a highly nonlinear force–extension curve, plus temperature- and rate-dependence, aging, and hysteresis.

- Energy transfer and release
  - Flywheel: Mechanically defined engagement window (clutch/belt) and deterministic release.
  - Slingshot: Snap release with high sensitivity to release angle and timing; finger release introduces variability and yaw.

- Guidance and alignment
  - Flywheel: Rigid rail/sabot defines projectile path and reduces initial tipoff.
  - Slingshot: Short support length (fork) and flexible bands; projectile alignment depends on pouch symmetry and operator form.

Implications for contest scoring
- Precision and repeatability
  - Slingshot challenges: Shot-to-shot variation from draw length, anchor point, hand torque, and elastomer drift. Temperature swings can shift band behavior noticeably.
  - Mitigations (conceptual): Fixed draw stops or indexed anchor points; a neutral, symmetric mechanical release instead of fingers; a short launch guide; and environmental conditioning of elastics. Expect more setup/calibration attention than with a flywheel system.

- Distance/efficiency
  - Slingshot strengths: High peak power and very low moving mass can yield strong exits for short strokes.
  - Tradeoffs: More parasitic losses from elastic hysteresis and pouch dynamics; difficult to maintain the same force–time profile across trials, which can hurt efficiency scoring.

- Operator ergonomics
  - Slingshot: Posture, anchor location, and grip stability matter greatly. Consistency favors a stance fixture or shoulder/forearm brace and a defined anchor reference rather than freehand variation.
  - Flywheel: Operator effort is decoupled from the instant of launch; ergonomics mainly affect spin-up comfort, not the shot itself.

Subsystem choices for a “contest-grade” slingshot concept (high-level only)
- Energy storage: Elastomer bands or tubes selected for low hysteresis and stable behavior; plan for preconditioning and periodic replacement to maintain consistency.
- Release: Symmetric, low-friction mechanical release to reduce yaw and timing jitter.
- Draw control: Hard draw stop and an indexed anchor reference to enforce identical stroke length each shot.
- Guidance: Short, rigid launch guide or sabot interface to improve initial alignment without adding much drag.
- Metrology: Non-contact speed gates and simple draw-length/force logging to correlate performance with elastic state and environment.
- Safety and durability: Shields around forks/bands, and clear inspection intervals for the elastics due to their snap-failure mode.

Key tradeoffs versus the flywheel concept
- Simplicity/portability vs control: Slingshots are compact and light but place more burden on calibration and operator discipline to hit repeatability metrics.
- Environmental sensitivity: Elastics respond to temperature and cycling; a flywheel system is largely insensitive once balanced.
- Cadence: Slingshots can shoot quickly; the flywheel needs spin-up time. If the contest values throughput, that can matter.
- Measurement-driven tuning: A slingshot benefits disproportionately from careful metrology and environmental management to approach the repeatability you can “dial in” on a flywheel design.

Bottom line
- If the contest prioritizes precision and repeatability, the flywheel/linear-rail approach has an inherent advantage.
- If portability and simplicity are valued, a slingshot-based entry can be competitive—provided you invest in draw control, a symmetric release, basic guidance, and environmental management to tame variability.
