Great question. A “simple slingshot” sits at the opposite end of the spectrum from a flywheel rail launcher in how it stores and releases energy, so the design priorities shift. Here’s a high‑level comparison framed by the same subsystems and contest goals.

Energy input and storage
- Rail/flywheel concept: Human effort is buffered into a flywheel, decoupling user variability from the shot.
- Slingshot concept: Human effort is coupled directly into elastomer stretch. Performance is highly sensitive to draw length, draw speed, temperature, and elastomer aging.
- Implication for scoring: Distance and precision hinge on controlling draw length/angle and managing elastomer condition. Emphasize instrumentation and procedures for consistency rather than mechanical energy shaping.

Acceleration profile and transfer
- Rail/flywheel: Can approximate constant acceleration and timed release.
- Slingshot: Highly nonlinear force–draw curve with very rapid acceleration at release. The pouch and projectile separate dynamically, which can introduce dispersion.
- Implication: Precision favors repeatable release geometry and timing. Conceptually, a fixed draw stop and a consistent, low‑disturbance release mechanism will matter more than trying to “shape” the force.

Guidance and alignment
- Rail/flywheel: Full mechanical guidance constrains yaw/pitch during acceleration.
- Slingshot: Minimal guidance; alignment comes from frame symmetry, band symmetry, and pouch behavior.
- Implication: Presentation focus on minimizing asymmetries (left/right band stretch, pouch twist) and maintaining a consistent launch angle. A rigid, well‑aligned frame with fine aiming adjustments is more valuable than added complexity elsewhere.

Aiming and user coupling
- Rail/flywheel: Recoil isolation and triggers reduce user influence.
- Slingshot: The user’s grip, wrist motion, and anchor point dominate aim. Any motion at release directly perturbs the shot.
- Implication: For repeatability, show how you reduce user coupling conceptually—e.g., a stable rest, consistent anchor reference, and a release action that doesn’t introduce torque.

Sensing and repeatability levers
- Rail/flywheel: RPM and carriage sensors control the shot profile.
- Slingshot: Key variables to observe are draw length, band temperature, and release alignment.
- Implication: Your “control system” is procedural and measurement‑based—think simple, non-contact indicators for draw length and a routine to check elastomer condition between shots.

Safety envelope
- Rail/flywheel: Energy is enclosed; interlocks manage engagement.
- Slingshot: Open elastomer under tension; snapback and projectile path are the main risks.
- Implication: Guard the band path where practical, define a safe draw zone, and use clear, consistent loading protocols in the concept.

Tradeoffs specific to a slingshot entry
- Pros: Very portable, fast cycle time, visually intuitive, easy to reset. With disciplined procedures, can be impressively repeatable at moderate ranges.
- Cons: More sensitive to environmental factors and user micro‑motions; elastomer hysteresis reduces energy efficiency; precision depends on managing small asymmetries.
- What to emphasize to judges: A clear control plan for draw length/angle, an inspection/conditioning routine for elastics, and evidence (conceptually or with mock data) of low shot‑to‑shot variance.

If you want a parallel concept label for presentation: “IsoDraw — Instrumented Fixed‑Draw Elastic Launcher,” highlighting a rigid, symmetric frame, a defined draw stop, a low‑disturbance release action, and simple sensing for draw length and alignment. Keeping it conceptual avoids complexity while addressing the main precision bottlenecks unique to slingshots.
