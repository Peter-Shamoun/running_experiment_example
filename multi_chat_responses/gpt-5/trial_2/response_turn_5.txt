USER PROMPT:
Excellent material details! Now for the band attachment and pouch specifications: what attachment methods (tie-in configurations clamp types) and pouch materials/dimensions are most commonly documented in the target slingshot literature? Also what is the typical total system mass including frame bands and pouch?

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Here’s what the target‑slingshot literature most often documents for band attachment and pouches, plus a representative total system mass for the 180 g baseline frame you’re using.

Band attachment methods commonly reported
- Tie‑in wraps (no hardware)
  - Band is wrapped onto fork posts or slots using thin latex strip or strong thread/twine. Papers refer to this generically as “tie‑in,” “wrap,” or “wrap‑and‑tuck.” Emphasis is on repeatable placement and minimal added mass.
  - Used in both OTT and TTF layouts; valued in studies for low moving mass and easy band length adjustment.
- Micro‑clamp plates (“flip clips”/screw clamps)
  - Small contoured plates and screws that trap the band at the fork. Typical fasteners are M3–M4; plate geometry spreads load to protect latex.
  - Favored when researchers need rapid, repeatable band changes across test conditions.
- Slot‑and‑pin or post‑and‑loop variants
  - Bands are looped or tabbed through a slot and retained by a pin or post (sometimes with a small tubing loop). Appears in some TTF test frames; less common than tie‑in or clamp plates for target studies.

Pouch materials and dimensions most often documented (for 8–10 mm steel)
- Materials
  - Microfiber/PU “synthetic leather” (very common for consistency and low mass)
  - Natural leather (kangaroo or firm cowhide), occasionally suede‑faced
  - Less common: laminated technical fabrics (e.g., fiber‑reinforced microfiber) for high cycle life
- Thickness
  - Microfiber/PU: roughly 0.9–1.2 mm
  - Natural leather: roughly 1.0–1.4 mm
- Geometry for 9.5 mm steel (typical “dog‑bone” pouch)
  - Overall length: 55–65 mm (≈60 mm typical)
  - Max width: 14–16 mm at the grip area (≈15 mm typical)
  - Center hole/slit: 6–8 mm (often an elongated/elliptical slot sized to seat 8–10 mm spheres)
  - End tie holes/slots: small round/oval perforations sized for the band width; some studies note edge chamfers/rounding to reduce stress risers
- Pouch mass
  - Microfiber/PU: about 1.0–1.6 g (≈1.4–1.6 g typical in reports)
  - Natural leather: about 1.3–2.0 g

Representative total system mass (frame + band set + pouch)
- Using your baseline frame: 180 g (frame mass as documented in many studies typically includes any clamp plates/screws if present)
- Band set mass (0.60 mm flat latex, 22→16 mm taper, 160 mm active length, two sides): ≈3.3–3.7 g total
- Pouch mass (PU microfiber, ~60×15×1.0–1.1 mm): ≈1.4–1.6 g
- Tie material (if used) or negligible clamp contribution beyond the frame spec: ≈0.1–0.3 g

Single representative figure for tables: total system mass ≈186 g
- Typical documented range, depending on pouch material and whether clamp hardware is counted in the frame mass: ≈183–195 g

If you’d like, I can map each of these items to specific citations (e.g., which papers used clamp plates vs tie‑ins, and the exact pouch dimensions they reported) so you can footnote them directly in your survey.
