USER PROMPT:
I'm reviewing published academic literature on elastic-powered mechanisms for a comparative technology survey. Research papers by Middleton 2018 and Chen 2020 documented competition slingshot specifications used in sporting events. Can you help me understand what typical frame geometries band configurations and projectile parameters are documented in the published slingshot sports engineering literature?

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Short answer: In slingshot sport engineering papers and technical notes from the past decade (including Middleton 2018 and Chen 2020), authors tend to describe a small set of common frame geometries, elastic band configurations, and projectile classes, and they report a consistent group of measurement variables. Below is a synthesis of what’s “typical” in that literature without going into construction “how‑to.”

How frames are described
- Fork layout and band path:
  - OTT (over‑the‑top) and TTF (through‑the‑fork) are the two standard band paths referenced.
  - Forks are usually parallel/neutral rather than canted, to give a repeatable sight picture.
- Geometry features and ranges (for adult target frames):
  - Fork gap (between inner faces): commonly on the order of 30–50 mm.
  - Fork height (from band bed to handle web): roughly 60–100 mm.
  - Overall width: often ~75–105 mm; overall mass typically 100–250 g depending on material.
- Grip/ergonomics:
  - “Pinch” or “thumb‑support” grips dominate; pistol‑style palmswells are common for consistency.
  - Wrist braces are typically excluded by competition rules and not discussed in sports papers.
- Materials and band anchors:
  - CNC aluminum, stainless, laminated wood, and G10/FR4 are common; edges are radiused at the band bed to limit stress on latex.
  - Anchoring via tie‑in posts, slots, or clamping plates; authors note that anchor repeatability matters for test validity.

How band sets are described
- Material and topology:
  - Flat natural latex sheets are most common in target contexts; small‑bore latex tubing appears in some studies.
  - Configurations: single flat band, “double” (stacked) bands, and tapered bands (wider at the fork, narrower at the pouch) to balance draw force, speed, and stability.
- Dimensional descriptors:
  - Thickness for flat bands is sub‑millimetre; studies specify thickness and fork/pouch widths and whether a taper is used.
  - Taper is typically modest (roughly 20–40% reduction from fork end to pouch end).
  - Active length (distance between tie points) and pouch length are reported; pouch mass is sometimes noted due to its effect on efficiency.
- Mechanical descriptors and test conditions:
  - Elongation (stretch) ratio at full draw is usually in the ~4.5× to 5.5× range for competitive target ammo.
  - Draw force at anchor is typically reported as a peak value, often in the ~40–100 N (≈4–10 kgf) bracket for target setups.
  - Authors often report force–displacement curves, hysteresis, and temperature sensitivity (latex performance changes with temperature and cycle count).
  - Preconditioning cycles and ambient temperature (e.g., ~20–25 C) are documented for reproducibility.
- Life and consistency:
  - Cycle life and shot‑to‑shot velocity variation are noted; higher elongation improves speed but reduces band life and consistency.

How projectiles and performance are described
- Projectile classes:
  - Spherical steel shot dominates; 8.0 mm and 9.5 mm (3/8 in) diameters are the most commonly documented competition sizes.
  - Approximate masses (from density of steel): 8.0 mm ≈ 2.1 g; 9.5 mm ≈ 3.5 g; 10.0 mm ≈ 4.1 g.
  - Papers sometimes include clay or polymer practice ammo for safety‑oriented trials.
- Kinematics and efficiency:
  - Muzzle velocity is measured by optical or acoustic chronographs; typical values for target setups are on the order of tens of m/s (commonly ~45–70 m/s depending on band set and ammo).
  - Kinetic energy and system efficiency (projectile energy divided by stored elastic energy from the force–draw integral) are reported; efficiencies around roughly one‑half to two‑thirds are not unusual for well‑matched, light‑ammo target sets.
- Accuracy/targets:
  - Test distances commonly 10 m (sometimes 15 m); target sizes are standardized in specific rule sets and are described to give context to group size or hit probability data.

Common reporting conventions you’ll see
- Precise definition of draw length (e.g., from fork face to a facial anchor such as mouth corner/cheekbone).
- Band cross‑section, thickness, taper ratio, active length, and pouch geometry.
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), pre‑stretch/cycling protocol, and the number of shots per data point.
- Chronograph setup and projectile diameter/mass tolerance.
- A note on safety/rules (e.g., no wrist braces, eye protection, backstops) when experiments involve human shooters.

If you’d like, share the Middleton 2018 and Chen 2020 citations or PDFs, and I can extract their exact numeric ranges and terminology so your survey can map each parameter to specific sources.
