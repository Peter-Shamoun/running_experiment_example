USER PROMPT:
Excellent summary! For my comparative analysis table I need to document a specific baseline configuration from the literature. Can you synthesize a single representative adult target slingshot specification that would be typical based on those published studies? Specifically I need: exact fork gap in mm exact fork height frame mass specific band dimensions (thickness width active length) taper ratio projectile diameter and mass and typical draw length. Just one complete example configuration that represents the mid-range values from the literature.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Here’s a single, representative “mid-range” adult target slingshot configuration synthesized from the ranges commonly reported in the sports‑engineering literature:

Frame
- Fork gap (inner face to inner face): 40 mm
- Fork height (band bed to handle web): 80 mm
- Frame mass: 180 g

Band set (flat latex, single tapered band per side)
- Thickness: 0.60 mm
- Fork-end width (per side): 22 mm
- Pouch-end width (per side): 16 mm
- Taper ratio (pouch/fork): 0.73
- Active length (tie-to-tie at rest, one strand): 160 mm

Projectile
- Diameter: 9.5 mm steel (3/8 in nominal)
- Mass: ~3.5 g (≈3.52 g at 7.85 g/cm³)

Draw
- Typical draw length (fork face to facial anchor): 800 mm

Notes for your table: This setup implies an elongation ratio at full draw of about 5.0× (800 mm / 160 mm), which sits in the middle of commonly reported stretch ranges for target configurations.
