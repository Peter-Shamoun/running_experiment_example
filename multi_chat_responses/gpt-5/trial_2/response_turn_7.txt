Short answer
- Using rock or steel spheres would be unsafe in practice and, in your “max‑power” simulation, very likely non‑compliant on energy unless you strictly cap speed or limit projectile mass.
- Why unsafe: denser/harder projectiles carry more kinetic energy for the same speed, penetrate more, and ricochet violently. Rocks add irregular shape, off‑axis release, fragmentation, and unpredictable flight.

Why energy would exceed the 60 J cap (math‑light)
- Kinetic energy is E = 0.5 · m · v². For a fixed speed v, denser projectiles (steel, stone) make m larger and push E up.
- Your max‑power variant assumes very high peak band force and long draw, so simulated muzzle speeds that are modest for light polymer ammo can push dense ammo over the cap.

60 J “threshold speeds” for typical steel spheres (so you can sanity‑check your sim)
- 10 mm dia steel (≈4.1 g): needs v ≥ ~171 m/s to hit 60 J.
- 12.7 mm (½ in, ≈8.4 g): v ≥ ~119 m/s to hit 60 J.
- 16 mm (≈16.8 g): v ≥ ~85 m/s to hit 60 J.
- 20 mm (≈33.5 g): v ≥ ~60 m/s to hit 60 J.
Interpretation:
- Larger steel balls exceed 60 J at comparatively modest speeds (e.g., a 20 mm sphere at ~60 m/s is already ~60 J).
- Smaller steel balls need very high speeds to reach 60 J, but your max‑force, long‑draw model can plausibly push lighter ammo into that regime in simulation.

Rocks vs. steel
- Density: typical rock (~2600 kg/m³) is ~1/3 the density of steel (~7850 kg/m³), so a rock of the same size has ~1/3 the mass. It therefore needs ~√3 (~1.7×) higher speed than steel of the same size to reach 60 J. Still, irregular shape and fragmentation make rocks particularly unsafe.
- Ricochet and damage risk are higher with steel due to hardness and elasticity; rock can shatter unpredictably.

How to keep a sim under 60 J (if required)
- Use the cap directly: for a given simulated speed v, keep m ≤ 2Ecap / v². Examples:
  - At 50 m/s, m ≤ 48 g to stay ≤ 60 J.
  - At 70 m/s, m ≤ 24.5 g.
  - At 100 m/s, m ≤ 12 g.
- Or pick a low‑density projectile material/size so that even at your modeled speeds the product 0.5·m·v² stays below 60 J.

Bottom line
- In a max‑power slingshot simulation, substituting rock or steel greatly increases the chance of exceeding 60 J and introduces additional safety hazards (ricochet, penetration, fragmentation). Treat dense projectiles as non‑compliant by default unless your model explicitly shows m and v combinations that keep E ≤ 60 J. For safer, compliant scenarios, use low‑density, smooth, symmetric projectiles and cap the simulated velocity accordingly.
