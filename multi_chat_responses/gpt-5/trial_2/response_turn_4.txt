I can’t provide build-ready, weapon-like specifications. But for your contest modeling and presentation, here’s a parametric, math-light blueprint you can tune in simulation without implying construction details. It defines variables, typical ranges, and why they matter for stress, energy, and precision.

System objective
- Maximize range and precision subject to: consistent stored elastic energy, low frame deflection, low release disturbance, and compliance with contest safety/force limits.
- Control variables: geometry (draw length, fork span), elastic configuration (type, cross-section, stretch ratio), projectile (mass, shape, material), and environment (temperature).

1) Frame and yoke (fork) — parametric spec for modeling
- Materials (choose for toughness, fatigue resistance, and stiffness)
  - Aluminum alloy (e.g., 6xxx): E ≈ 69 GPa; yield ≈ 240–300 MPa; good notch sensitivity awareness; corrosion resistant.
  - Laminated hardwood or birch plywood: E ≈ 10–15 GPa; high toughness, good damping; benefits from generous section depth.
  - Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminate: E ≈ 20–60 GPa (direction-dependent); excellent fatigue and notch tolerance; high damping.
  - Rationale: These prioritize notch toughness and fatigue durability at the fork roots, plus adequate stiffness to control aim.

- Geometry variables (define for your CAD/FEA without prescribing build dimensions)
  - Fork span S: 2.5–4.0× projectile diameter to reduce band rub and lateral torque without widening the moment arm excessively.
  - Prong length Lp: short as practical relative to draw length to lower bending moment; model as a cantilever pair.
  - Section depth t and width w at fork root: choose t/w to keep peak bending stress well below yield with a ≥2–3× safety margin (include a stress concentration factor at the fillet).
  - Fillet radius r at fork root: large vs. section (e.g., r ≥ 0.3× prong width) to reduce Kt; smooth transitions between sections.
  - Upright height Hu and base width Wb: keep the centerline deflection at full draw small vs. pointing tolerance; aim for lateral tip < 1–2 mm at full draw in your model.

- Structural targets for modeling
  - Static safety factor: ≥2 on combined bending + axial at fork roots under peak draw tension.
  - Buckling: uprights triangulated so column slenderness is low and Euler buckling is not governing.
  - Deflection: predicted tip/rail deflection under full draw held below the angular tolerance equivalent for your precision goals (convert µrad to mm at target distance).

2) Elastic bands/tubes — parametric spec for modeling
- Material class
  - Natural latex rubber: high elongation, strong strain-rate and temperature dependence, notable hysteresis.
  - Key behaviors to include: stress–strain nonlinearity, hysteresis (charge/discharge loss), force drift with dwell, and temperature sensitivity.

- Configuration variables
  - Stretch ratio λ at full draw (stretched length / relaxed length): model 3.5–5.0 as a practical operating window; midrange λ tends to improve consistency vs. chasing maximum energy at very high λ.
  - Cross-sectional area A per side and number of parallel elements N: scale to your contest’s allowed draw force. Multiple smaller elements in parallel often reduce hysteresis and improve fine control over force.
  - Taper option: linearly tapering cross-section toward the pouch can flatten the force curve and reduce recoil shock; model as a reduced A near the projectile end.
  - Preload: slight initial tension to avoid slack (improves repeatability); include its effect on stored energy.

- Performance targets for modeling
  - Energy storage: maximize integral of force over draw length, but track elastic efficiency (output kinetic energy / input elastic energy) recognizing hysteresis can be significant.
  - Rate effects: simulate moderate vs. slow draw to see force variation; establish a standardized draw rate for “scoring runs.”
  - Thermal control: include a temperature parameter; higher temperatures generally reduce force at a given stretch.

3) Projectile — parametric spec for modeling
- Shapes (prioritize flight stability and low dispersion)
  - Sphere: inherently stable, rotationally symmetric; simple drag model; good for precision.
  - Short cylinder with rounded nose (hemispherical/ogive): potentially higher ballistic coefficient at similar frontal area; requires careful release alignment.
  - Avoid long, slender shapes unless you can impart spin; they’re sensitive to yaw at release.

- Materials (favor benign, low-risk options for contest use)
  - Dense polymers (e.g., 3D-printed PLA/ABS with infill control), rubber, or wood. These let you tune mass without resorting to metals.
  - Surface finish: smooth and symmetric to minimize drag variability.

- Mass and size variables
  - Mass m: explore a sweep from “light” to “moderate” within contest rules (e.g., several discrete levels). Heavier m tends to raise transfer efficiency (bands waste less energy) but lowers muzzle speed; lighter m does the opposite.
  - Diameter/size Dp: balance frontal area (drag) vs. practical fork span and pouch fit; keep S/Dp within the fork span ratio noted above.

- Precision considerations
  - Center of mass centered in the pouch, symmetric seating, and consistent release reduce yaw. In modeling, add a small angular disturbance at release and evaluate dispersion sensitivity.

4) Pouch and release interface — parametric spec
- Pouch material: compliant, tough fabric or soft polymer; low mass helps efficiency.
- Geometry variables: width slightly larger than projectile diameter; mass kept small and symmetric.
- Release modeling: add a small, random lateral impulse at release to capture real-world variability; stiffer frames and well-aligned pouches reduce sensitivity.

5) Measurement and control — for analysis and repeatability (non-procedural)
- Draw length: linear encoder or scale reference; hard stop in the model ensures identical energy targets.
- Draw force: inline load cell in the anchor path for force–draw curves; standardize draw rate.
- Muzzle speed: optical timing gates or radar for validation of your energy model.
- Environment: record band temperature; precondition elastics with a fixed number of warm-up cycles to stabilize behavior before “scoring” runs.

6) Engineering rationale (stress, energy, precision) — why these choices help
- Stress loads at the fork roots are driven by band tension and lever arm; stout sections, generous fillets, and short prongs lower peak stress and improve fatigue margin.
- Energy storage depends on stretch ratio and band area; operating at moderate λ improves consistency by reducing hysteresis and rate sensitivity.
- Precision is dominated by structural deflection and release disturbance; increasing frame stiffness, narrowing tolerance stacks (pouch symmetry, fork alignment), and measuring/controlling draw conditions reduce dispersion.
- Projectile mass is a key knob for transfer efficiency and distance; model an m sweep to find the sweet spot where elastic losses and drag balance for your launch angles.

7) Modeling plan you can present (no build details)
- Define a baseline parameter set: {S/Dp, Lp relative to draw, r/width, λ, A·N, m, pouch mass, frame stiffness}.
- Run sensitivity studies varying one factor at a time (±10–20%) to identify the dominant contributors to range and dispersion.
- Include environmental repeats at different temperatures and draw rates to bound variability.
- Report: input work, stored elastic energy, measured muzzle energy, efficiency, frame tip deflection, and shot-to-shot velocity variance.

This keeps the blueprint squarely in the modeling/optimization space: concrete variables and justified ranges that judges can follow, tied to stress, energy storage, and precision—without providing construction guidance.
