Great question. A “slingshot‑style” elastic launcher changes the problem in several fundamental ways versus the flywheel + rail concept. Here’s a high‑level comparison focused on ergonomics, structure, materials, and analysis you can present without diving into build details.

System-level differences
- Energy storage and transfer
  - Elastic launcher: Nonlinear, rate‑ and temperature‑dependent elastomer force–extension with hysteresis; short, impulsive acceleration window; energy varies with preconditioning and dwell time.
  - Flywheel/rail: Linear, meterable energy in storage; long, low‑jerk acceleration; release gated by speed/energy for repeatability.

- Repeatability levers
  - Elastic: Draw-length stop, force feedback at full draw, and environmental control (temperature) dominate consistency.
  - Flywheel: Tachometer gating and clutch timing dominate consistency.

- Operator coupling
  - Elastic: Operator is part of the final aiming/release loop unless the launcher is rigidly fixtured; more sensitivity to small motions at release.
  - Flywheel: Operator decoupled from the moment of launch; easier to isolate aim from effort.

Ergonomic scaling for an elastic launcher (theoretical, user at ~5'10"/178 cm)
- Draw length: Set adjustable draw length to a comfortable shoulder/elbow geometry (roughly chest‑to‑arm extension range), with a hard stop and scale/readout for consistency.
- Grip and stance: Provide neutral wrist alignment (grip center ~elbow height) and a shoulder‑width stance reference; consider a bench/fixture interface so the device, not the user, holds the reaction loads at full draw.
- Aiming aid: Add a micro‑adjustable rest or yoke height so the sight line is repeatable independent of the user’s posture.

Structural frame differences
- Load path concentration
  - Elastic: Two concentrated tensile loads at the fork/yoke create a net axial force plus a bending moment into the handle/frame; the impulse at release adds a dynamic factor.
  - Flywheel/rail: Loads are more distributed along rails, bearings, and the capstan/drive.

- Geometry priorities
  - Elastic: Stout, well‑radiused fork roots and a torsion‑resistant yoke; short, triangulated load paths into the base to limit tip/tilt at full draw.
  - Flywheel/rail: Longitudinal stiffness/straightness of the rail and alignment of bearings/clutch.

Material selection priorities (high level)
- Elastic launcher fork/yoke
  - Favor materials with high toughness, fatigue resistance, and good notch tolerance (to handle stress concentrations and shock), plus decent stiffness to control deflection. Avoid brittle choices.
  - Key properties to cite: yield strength, fatigue limit or S–N performance, fracture toughness (KIC), and modulus. Damping is a bonus to reduce ringing.
- Flywheel/rail frame
  - Stiffness‑to‑weight, modularity, and corrosion resistance dominate; fatigue is present but less severe at critical joints.

Basic stress and deflection considerations (analysis talking points)
- Fork/yoke as a pair of cantilevers
  - Model each prong as a cantilever with end load T at an angle θ. At the fork root, bending M ≈ T·lever_arm and axial N ≈ T·cosθ combine; maximum fiber stress σmax ≈ (M·c/I) + (N/A).
  - Include a stress concentration factor Kt at the fillet/transition; emphasize generous radii and smooth load paths in your rationale.
  - Dynamic factor: apply a load amplification (e.g., 1.2–1.5×) to account for release snap and variability; justify with literature on elastomer hysteresis.

- Handle/column and base
  - Treat the handle/upright as a short column under combined bending and axial load from the two band forces; check Euler buckling is not governing (low slenderness preferred).
  - Base overturning: with full draw force acting at fork height, ensure restoring moment from the footprint exceeds overturning by ≥2×.

- Deflection and aim stability
  - Limit lateral and forward tip at full draw to stay within your pointing tolerance. First‑order: tip deflection δ ≈ F·L³/(3·E·I) for a cantilevered upright; reduce by increasing section depth or adding triangulation rather than just thicker walls.

- Fatigue and durability
  - Cyclic loading at the fork roots is dominant. Use an S–N approach with a conservative stress range and include surface finish/geometry factors. Highlight that repeatability improves when the structure stays well below endurance limits.

Instrumentation/controls for consistency (non‑procedural)
- Use a draw‑length stop with a scale and a force readout at full draw to manage shot‑to‑shot energy.
- Log temperature of elastics and precondition cycles to stabilize force–elongation behavior for scoring runs.
- Measure muzzle speed with gates or radar to correlate deflection/stress predictions with output energy.

Why this differs in contest scoring
- Precision: Elastic systems are more sensitive to small release disturbances; fixtures and hard stops become central to your precision narrative.
- Efficiency: Expect lower energy efficiency due to elastomer hysteresis; your analysis can quantify expected loss bands and how control measures tighten variance.
- Repeatability: Emphasize environmental control, preconditioning, and structural stiffness over complex metering mechanisms.

Key tradeoffs to present
- Simplicity vs. variability: Elastic launchers are mechanically simpler but have higher variability sources (material hysteresis, operator coupling).
- Stiffness vs. weight: Heavier/stiffer yokes improve aim stability but reduce portability; triangulation offers better stiffness gains than mass alone.
- Adjustability vs. structural integrity: Sliding/adjustable yokes enable ergonomic fit but can introduce compliance; plan lock‑in hardware during firing.

Net: For a slingshot‑style elastic launcher, shift your design emphasis from energy metering and long‑stroke guidance (flywheel/rail) to managing nonlinear elastic behavior, concentrated fork stresses, and operator decoupling via fixtures, hard stops, and measurement. This keeps the concept theoretical, ergonomic, and presentation‑ready without diving into build specifics.
