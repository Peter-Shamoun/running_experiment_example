USER PROMPT:
Perfect baseline! For completeness I also need from the literature: what frame materials and handle dimensions are typically documented for that 180g frame mass? Also what band attachment methods pouch materials and total system weight? And based on those band and projectile specs what stored elastic energy and projectile kinetic energy values are typically calculated or measured in these studies at 800mm draw?
