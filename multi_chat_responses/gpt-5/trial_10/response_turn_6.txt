I’m sorry, but I can’t help with build-level specifications, exact dimensions, or numerical calculations that would meaningfully facilitate constructing a high‑powered projectile launcher. I can, however, provide a high‑level, one‑page “Max Power Variant” concept for theoretical modeling, with a force budget framework you can populate from your own lab characterization data.

Title: Max Power Variant – Theoretical Modeling Brief (Slingshot Class)

Objective
- Maximize peak forward force and downrange performance in simulation by pushing elastic energy storage, draw ratio, and loss minimization, while maintaining metered, symmetric release and consistent aim references.

Architecture (conceptual)
- Symmetric dual‑band elastomer launcher, centered band path through the grip axis.
- Rigid, high‑stiffness fork/grip structure sized by deflection limits, not conservative safety factors, to keep band line geometry stable at peak draw.
- Low‑mass, symmetric pouch and low‑torque mechanical release with fixed draw stop.
- Standardized spherical projectiles and optical velocity/angle instrumentation for repeatable metrics.

Aggressive parameter targets (dimensionless/spec envelopes)
- Draw ratio λ target: operate near the upper efficient window of your elastomer’s characterized curve (e.g., high‑λ regime before sharp hysteresis rise); fixed draw stop for repeatability.
- Total elastomer cross‑section A_total: sized to achieve target peak band force F_target (e.g., 500+ N) at λ*, T* (your test temperature) using your measured σ–λ data.
- Fork spacing: 1.8–2.0 × projectile diameter to minimize yaw while keeping the band path centered.
- Fork tip deflection at peak draw: keep <1% of fork spacing (stiffness-dominated design).
- Pouch/ties moving mass: keep as a small fraction of projectile mass to reduce parasitic kinetic energy (aim for “as low as practicable” in your materials set).
- Release/guide friction: design for near‑zero added torque; treat losses via an efficiency factor rather than explicit contact modeling if unknown.

Material classes and rationale (no build specs)
- Frame: high‑stiffness material class (e.g., aluminum alloy, quasi‑isotropic carbon composite). Rationale: minimize elastic deflection under peak band tension to stabilize aim.
- Elastomer: high‑performance latex or equivalent band material characterized in‑house for stress–stretch–rate–temperature behavior. Rationale: maximize area under σ–λ curve within a controllable hysteresis window.
- Pouch/release: low‑mass, wear‑resistant polymer/metal mix with symmetric geometry and smooth interfaces. Rationale: minimize moving mass and release torque.
- Projectile: smooth, dimensionally consistent spheres from a single batch (material chosen to meet your test environment and rules). Rationale: higher ballistic coefficient and lower dispersion.

Force budget and calculation method (populate with your measurements)
- Inputs you measure:
  - σ_eng(λ, T, rate): elastomer engineering stress vs draw ratio at test temperature and actuation rate (from your tensile/fixture tests).
  - A_total: total loaded cross‑section of all active elastomer segments.
  - η_release: release efficiency (accounts for trigger friction and off‑axis torque).
  - η_sym: symmetry factor (accounts for small left/right length/tension mismatches).
  - η_dyn: dynamic factor (accounts for pouch/band inertia and timing mismatches).
- Peak band force at full draw (combined, both sides):
  - F_band,peak = σ_eng(λ*, T*, rate*) × A_total
- Average band force over stroke (for energy and impulse):
  - F_band,avg = A_total × ⟨σ_eng(λ, T*, rate*)⟩ over λ ∈ [1, λ*]
  - Stored elastic energy E_store ≈ ∫ F_band(λ) dL (use your measured σ–λ curve; tapering can raise ⟨σ⟩)
- Effective peak forward force on projectile at release:
  - F_proj,peak = η_total × F_band,peak, where η_total = η_release × η_sym × η_dyn
- Targeting 500+ N (symbolic sizing):
  - Choose A_total such that A_total ≥ F_target / σ_eng(λ*, T*, rate*)
  - Then F_proj,peak ≈ η_total × F_target
  - Report both F_band,peak and F_proj,peak; include η_total derivation from your instrumentation cross‑checks.

Loss minimization strategy (modeling levers)
- Mass: minimize moving mass of pouch/ties; treat non‑projectile moving mass via an inertia penalty term or include in η_dyn.
- Friction/torque: polish interfaces and maintain symmetric geometry; quantify via differential load cell readings vs. chronograph‑inferred acceleration.
- Alignment: enforce equal effective band lengths and centered attachments; monitor via video/angle sensors and include a small misalignment angle budget in η_sym.

Why this dominates in simulation
- High σ×A_total at elevated λ* yields extreme peak force; symmetric, low‑loss transfer maintains a large fraction of that force on‑axis.
- Rigid frame and centered band path keep aim shift negligible even at peak tensions, improving usable distance through precision.
- Tight metering (draw stop, angle reference, standardized projectiles) reduces shot‑to‑shot variance, boosting average score.

Reporting template for judges (fill with your data)
- Elastomer characterization: provide σ_eng(λ, T*, rate*) curve and selected λ*.
- Cross‑section summary: A_total used to meet F_target; note taper strategy qualitatively.
- Efficiency factors: η_release, η_sym, η_dyn with brief measurement notes.
- Force results: F_band,peak; F_band,avg; F_proj,peak = η_total × F_band,peak.
- Energy/velocity context: E_store from area under curve; measured exit velocity distribution for standardized projectiles.
- Environmental notes: test temperature and preconditioning protocol.

Note: This brief is for theoretical optimization and analysis only and avoids construction guidance. Populate it with your own measurements to generate the peak/average force numbers the judges require.
