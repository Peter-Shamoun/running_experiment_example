Below is a modeling-oriented “spec envelope” for a contest-grade, simple slingshot system. It’s framed to support optimization (energy, stress, precision, repeatability) without being build-ready. Use it to parametrize your simulations and to justify choices in your judging presentation.

System goals and assumptions
- Priority: maximize distance with controllable dispersion in a safe, controlled test; emphasize repeatability and energy efficiency.
- User: average adult (~5'10"). Ergonomics focus on consistent anchor/draw, centered band path, and low wrist torque.
- Constraints: elastic energy storage via latex-type elastomer; symmetric fork; smooth, low-torque release; standardized projectile and instrumentation for consistent data.

Frame (fork-and-grip) specification envelope
- Geometry (for modeling, use ratios):
  - Fork tip spacing: 1.6–2.2 × projectile diameter to keep the band path centered while minimizing yaw on release.
  - Throat radius at fork roots: ≥ 3–5 × local thickness to suppress stress concentration.
  - Section thickness at fork crown: size for deflection first; target tip deflection under peak draw to be < 1–2% of fork spacing to limit aim shift.
  - Grip length and offset: grip-to-fork crown distance such that the band centerline passes through the grip axis to minimize wrist torque (model band centerline within ±5 mm of grip axis).
- Materials (select by stiffness-to-weight, fatigue, manufacturability):
  - Aluminum alloy (e.g., heat-treatable series):
    - Typical properties: E ≈ 69 GPa, yield ≈ 240–300 MPa, density ≈ 2.7 g/cc, good machinability.
    - Rationale: predictable, stiff, easy to keep straight; good for tight tolerances and instrumentation mounting.
  - Carbon fiber composite (quasi-isotropic layup):
    - Typical properties: E (in-plane) ≈ 70–120 GPa, tensile strength ≈ 600–1000 MPa, density ≈ 1.5–1.6 g/cc.
    - Rationale: high stiffness-to-weight limits fork tip movement; excellent for low mass and low hand shock. Needs careful radius and bearing surface design.
  - Glass-filled nylon (engineering-grade):
    - Typical properties: E ≈ 7–12 GPa, yield ≈ 90–130 MPa, density ≈ 1.3–1.5 g/cc, good damping.
    - Rationale: forgiving, damped feel; useful for quick prototyping. Larger sections required to control deflection.
- Basic stress and deflection rationale
  - Peak band tension (total both sides) for a midrange setup is commonly on the order of a few hundred newtons; size the fork crown for:
    - Bending moment ≈ (total tension/2) × (fork tip spacing/2).
    - Keep von Mises stress under about 1/3–1/2 of material yield (static) with a fatigue margin; aim for factor of safety 2–3.
    - Check lateral stiffness so lateral tip deflection under asymmetric release forces stays a small fraction of projectile diameter.

Elastomer band pack
- Configuration: symmetric left/right bands with a centered pouch; consider tapered bands or tapered multi-strand packs to flatten the force curve.
- Material: natural latex elastomer formulated for exercise/therapeutic bands or purpose-made slingshot bands.
  - Behavior: strongly nonlinear, rate- and temperature-dependent; exhibits hysteresis and creep. Efficiency improves when operated in a mid-strain window and moderate retraction speed.
- Key modeling parameters (use these as variables to sweep):
  - Rest length vs. draw length: draw ratio (stretched/rest) in the 3.5–5.0 range is a typical efficiency window; avoid extreme pre-tension that accelerates aging.
  - Cross-section area: choose to set peak force target; higher area increases force but penalizes efficiency if projectile is too light.
  - Taper: 30–60% width reduction from fork to pouch side often “linearizes” force and reduces shock at release.
  - Operating temperature: include ±10°C sensitivity; expect noticeable force drift per degree for latex.
- Durability and repeatability:
  - Precondition bands with a consistent warm-up number of draws to stabilize behavior before measured runs.
  - Limit peak strain to extend life; track cycles and replace on schedule for consistent data.

Pouch and release
- Pouch: thin, symmetric, low-mass, with holes or texture to prevent projectile slip; mass kept small relative to projectile to reduce parasitic energy.
- Attachment: centerline alignment with equal-length ties/loops; aim for <1 mm length asymmetry.
- Release aid: a low-friction, symmetric mechanical release reduces lateral torque and improves grouping; model trigger break force low and consistent to avoid imparting yaw.
- Short alignment guide (optional): a short, low-friction cradle or ring aligned to the band centerline can reduce initial tip-off without acting as a barrel.

Projectile
- Shape: spherical or very short ogive-ended cylinder for consistent launch and predictable drag. Spheres are easiest to standardize; cylinders can reduce spin/yaw sensitivity when guided.
- Size and mass:
  - Balance “impedance” between bands and projectile. Too light: high muzzle velocity but low ballistic coefficient and more dispersion; too heavy: low muzzle velocity but better BC.
  - Modeling envelope: mass from ~25 g to ~100 g; diameter scaled to maintain reasonable sectional density and safe handling in your test environment.
- Material:
  - For distance-focused outdoor tests: dense, smooth spheres (e.g., steel/ceramic) maximize ballistic coefficient; ensure safety controls in place.
  - For controlled indoor tests: consider dense-core polymer spheres or padded projectiles to protect range infrastructure; trade some range for safety.
- Aerodynamics:
  - Use Cd ≈ 0.45–0.50 for smooth spheres at moderate Reynolds numbers as a baseline; include sensitivity to spin and small yaw angles.
  - Surface finish matters; smoother projectiles reduce dispersion and improve distance.

Measurement and metering
- Draw metering:
  - Fixed mechanical draw stop referenced to the frame; repeatability target ±0.5 mm.
  - Tension indication: in-line load cell or calibrated scale to log peak draw force for each shot.
- Velocity:
  - Optical chronograph or short optical gate pair near the muzzle to measure projectile speed; sample multiple shots for mean and standard deviation.
- Angle and alignment:
  - Bubble/tilt sensor and a simple sight reference to maintain consistent elevation and azimuth; record angle to ±0.2°.
- Environment:
  - Band temperature sensor (surface IR or embedded thermistor proxy) to annotate data; normalize results to a reference temperature.

Energy and efficiency rationale (math-light)
- Stored energy is the area under the force–stretch curve of the elastomer; tapered bands and appropriate draw ratio increase usable energy and reduce hysteresis losses.
- Transfer efficiency benefits from:
  - Matching projectile mass to the band’s power profile so bands are not “snapping back” after projectile exit.
  - Low moving mass in pouch/ties to minimize parasitic kinetic energy.
  - Symmetry in band lengths and attachment to minimize lateral energy lost to yaw.
- Practical efficiency range for well-tuned setups often falls around tens of percent from stored elastic energy to projectile kinetic energy; your optimization should aim to push this upward via tapering, mass match, and clean release.

Precision and repeatability considerations
- Control variables: draw length, peak tension, release symmetry, band temperature, projectile mass/diameter, and launch angle.
- Design to reduce sensitivity:
  - Stiff frame with low fork tip deflection.
  - Centered band path through the grip axis to reduce wrist-induced torque.
  - Symmetric, low-friction release and matched band lengths.
  - Standardized projectiles with tight mass/diameter tolerance.
- Instrumentation-driven workflow: precondition bands, confirm temperature, set draw stop, verify tension window, log velocity and angle, then fire.

Tradeoffs to present
- Higher band cross-section vs. heavier projectile for range: gains in distance with better mass matching but more user draw effort and slower cadence.
- Tapered vs. untapered bands: better efficiency/comfort versus added fabrication complexity and potential variability.
- Stiffer frame materials vs. cost/weight: improved precision versus manufacturing and budget constraints.
- Release aid vs. simplicity: tighter groups versus added mechanism and potential failure modes.

Safety and compliance notes for judging
- Emphasize your metering, stops, and guards; include a positive procedure for band inspection and replacement.
- Use range-appropriate projectiles and capture nets; document angle limits and backstop requirements.
- Clearly state that this is a theoretical optimization envelope, not construction guidance.

Using this envelope, you can build a parametric model: vary band draw ratio, cross-section/taper, projectile mass/diameter, and frame stiffness to locate the sweet spot where stored elastic energy, transfer efficiency, and ballistic coefficient combine for maximum distance at acceptable dispersion.
