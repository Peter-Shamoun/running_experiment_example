Concept name: IsoFly – Counter‑Rotating Flywheel Cam Launcher

Core subsystems:
- Human-input drivetrain: ergonomic cranks/pedals feeding a geared transmission with a one‑way clutch so input is smoothed and stored.
- Energy storage: paired counter‑rotating flywheels to buffer human variability and cancel gyroscopic effects.
- Energy metering and transfer: a shaped cam (or variable-radius drum) driving a linear pusher carriage to impose a precise acceleration profile along a long guide.
- Guidance and launch tube: low-friction rail/tube with a separable pusher/sabot for clean release and minimal parasitic losses.
- Aiming and calibration: fine azimuth/elevation adjustment and simple velocity/angle sensing for repeatable setup and data logging.
- Safety and controls: torque‑limiting clutch, overspeed governor, and a positive energy‑dump brake.

Why it excels in contest scoring:
- Repeatability: the flywheel decouples human input variability from the launch, yielding consistent muzzle velocity and angle.
- Efficiency: a long, controlled force profile reduces peak losses and better matches the projectile’s acceleration needs.
- Precision: counter‑rotating flywheels prevent aim drift; fine aiming plus feedback enables tight grouping.
- Tunability: cam profile and gearing can be adjusted for distance vs. precision modes without changing the basic platform.
- Human‑power utilization: participants can contribute energy over several seconds, then release it in a precisely timed impulse.

Key tradeoffs to present:
- Complexity vs. simplicity: added parts (flywheels, cam, clutch) improve control but increase mass, friction, and setup time.
- Spin‑up time vs. throughput: higher stored energy improves range but slows cadence between shots.
- Tolerances vs. cost: precise cam/guide geometry boosts repeatability but demands tighter manufacturing.
- Safety margin vs. peak performance: conservative governors/clutches protect users and hardware but cap achievable velocity.
- Rule compliance: ensure energy storage and materials align with contest constraints on human power and safety.
