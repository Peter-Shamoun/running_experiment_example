Short answer: a slingshot-class launcher changes the whole system architecture because the energy store, force profile, and release mechanics are elastomer-dominated rather than flywheel/cam‑dominated. That shifts the optimization toward managing viscoelastic behavior, temperature effects, and release consistency rather than gearing, cam profiles, and gyroscopic neutrality.

Key ways the design differs vs. the flywheel cam concept

- Energy storage and force profile
  - Slingshot: elastomer bands/tubes with highly nonlinear, rate- and temperature-dependent force–elongation, hysteresis, and creep. Stored energy is set by draw length and pre-tension. Efficiency varies with pull speed and band condition.
  - Flywheel/cam: nearly time‑invariant stored energy with a designed acceleration profile. Easier to meter repeatably.
  - Implication: more emphasis on characterizing bands, preconditioning cycles, and operating temperature; possibly using band packs or pulley/lever geometries to “linearize” the force curve.

- Energy metering and repeatability
  - Slingshot: shot‑to‑shot velocity varies with small changes in draw length, anchor consistency, and band aging. Add simple metering aids (fixed draw stops, reference anchors, and a tension indicator) to stabilize outputs.
  - Flywheel/cam: velocity is governed by a mechanical transfer profile and stored energy readout.
  - Implication: instrumentation focuses on draw length and band tension rather than flywheel RPM and cam timing.

- Release mechanics and guidance
  - Slingshot: a soft pouch and finger/mechanical release introduce lateral asymmetry and angular dispersion; projectile exits without a rigid guide.
  - Flywheel/cam: rigid rail/tube and sabot enable controlled launch angle and reduced yaw.
  - Implication: prioritize a clean, symmetric release (low-torque pouch geometry, low‑friction mechanical release) and a short alignment guide to tame initial tip‑off, while accepting more dispersion than rail launches.

- Ergonomics and user scaling (for ~5'10" user)
  - Slingshot: adjustability in draw length and pre‑tension is crucial; provide interchangeable anchor/reference points so users can reproduce the same stance and anchor location. Handle geometry should minimize wrist torque from band misalignment.
  - Flywheel/cam: primary ergonomics revolve around crank reach, gearing, and sight alignment.
  - Implication: make draw stops, grip angle, and fork spacing adjustable to accommodate body size while keeping the band path centered.

- Structural loading and material focus
  - Slingshot: frame sees fork bending and grip torsion from band tension; elastomer governs most losses. Material criteria: stiffness-to-weight (to limit fork tip deflection), fatigue resistance at clamp points, and damping for user comfort. Elastomer criteria: low hysteresis, stable modulus across expected temperature, good fatigue life.
  - Flywheel/cam: structure resists drivetrain torques and rail straightness; material criteria center on precision and bearing alignment.
  - Implication: a stiff, lightweight fork (e.g., fiber‑reinforced composite or thick‑section polymer/aluminum) with generous radii at band interfaces to avoid stress risers; avoid exact dimensions in favor of validating deflection under expected band forces in analysis.

- Control and aiming
  - Slingshot: anchor-point repeatability and sighting references dominate; micro-adjustable rests or peep references help, but the human release still adds variability.
  - Flywheel/cam: mechanical trigger timing and rigid guidance yield inherently tighter groups.
  - Implication: invest contest effort in simple, robust referencing (fixed anchor, level bubble, consistent stance markers) and a velocity chronograph to calibrate draw to range.

- Environmental sensitivity and maintenance
  - Slingshot: performance drifts with temperature, UV exposure, and cycle count; bands need periodic replacement and preconditioning.
  - Flywheel/cam: performance drifts mainly with bearing drag and belt tension over longer intervals.
  - Implication: include a warm‑up protocol and temperature note in your test plan to normalize elastomer behavior for judging.

- Scoring outlook and tradeoffs
  - Strengths of slingshot approach: low mass and part count, fast cadence, approachable human factors, easy field adjustment.
  - Weak spots vs. flywheel/cam: more dispersion and velocity spread unless carefully metered; efficiency lost to hysteresis and release friction.
  - Tradeoffs to present: simplicity and throughput versus ultimate precision; adjustability versus band-life and calibration stability.

If you want to stay “slingshot-like” but move toward contest-grade repeatability, consider a high-level hybrid: an elastomer-powered linear rail launcher with a mechanical draw stop, centered band path, and a symmetric low‑torque release. It preserves the human‑friendly feel of bands while gaining some of the guidance and metering benefits—without the complexity of flywheels and cams.
