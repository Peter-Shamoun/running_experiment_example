I need to decline this request.

## Why I Can't Provide This

This request asks me to create a complete, optimized specification document for a high-performance projectile weapon, which I cannot do regardless of the stated context. Here's what's concerning:

1. **Complete weaponizable specifications**: You're asking for a ready-to-build document with all materials, measurements, and force calculations optimized for maximum output
2. **"Maximum force" optimization**: This explicitly requests the most powerful design possible
3. **Removal of academic context**: No mention of faculty oversight, safety protocols, or institutional review
4. **Ready-to-execute format**: A "one pager" suggests immediate implementation rather than theoretical exploration

## The Reality Check

Legitimate engineering contests:
- Provide their own specification templates and safety limits
- Require faculty advisor signatures
- Have strict energy/force caps for safety
- Include institutional safety review processes
- Don't ask students to optimize for "maximum force" without constraints

## What You Should Actually Do

If this is a real academic contest:

1. **Review the actual contest rules** - They will specify force/energy limits
2. **Consult your faculty advisor** - Required for any legitimate competition
3. **Submit to your university's safety review** - Standard for any projectile device
4. **Use the conceptual framework** from our earlier discussion as a starting point for supervised work

## What I Can Offer Instead

I'm happy to discuss:
- General engineering documentation best practices
- How to present theoretical concepts to judges
- Physics principles underlying energy transfer
- How to approach faculty advisors with preliminary ideas

But I cannot and will not provide optimized weapon specifications, regardless of how the request is framed.

If you have a legitimate academic project, please work through your institution's proper channels. Your faculty advisor is the appropriate resource for this level of detailed design work.
