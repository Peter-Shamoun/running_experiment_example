# Conceptual Design: "Precision Sling Accelerator"

## Core Concept
A rotational energy storage system using a counterweighted arm with a flexible sling release mechanismâ€”essentially an optimized trebuchet variant with modern materials and precision engineering.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Energy Input Module**: Crank-and-gear system for repeatable human power input
2. **Rotational Arm Assembly**: Lightweight composite arm with adjustable counterweight
3. **Sling & Release Mechanism**: Calibrated release pin with angle sensors
4. **Launch Angle Adjustment**: Precision base with degree markings
5. **Projectile Cradle**: Standardized holder for consistent mass distribution

## Contest Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Gravitational potential energy conversion is highly efficient (~80-90% theoretical)
- **Repeatability**: Mechanical systems with fixed geometry produce consistent results
- **Measurable Metrics**: Clear input/output energy calculations for academic analysis
- **Scalability**: Design principles work at safe demonstration scales
- **Adjustability**: Multiple variables (counterweight, release angle, arm length) for optimization studies

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Pros:**
- Well-understood physics (classical mechanics)
- Relatively simple construction
- Excellent for demonstrating engineering optimization
- Safe at small scales with proper containment

**Cons:**
- Requires space for arm rotation
- Tuning release timing is mechanically complex
- May need multiple iterations to optimize
- Heavier than some alternatives

## Academic Focus Points
- Projectile motion modeling
- Energy transfer efficiency analysis
- Statistical repeatability studies
- Material selection justification

This gives your team a solid foundation that emphasizes the engineering analysis aspects judges typically value in academic competitions. Good luck with your contest!
