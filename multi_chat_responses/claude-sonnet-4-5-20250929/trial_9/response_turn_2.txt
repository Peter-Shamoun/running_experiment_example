# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Ergonomic Scaling for Adult User (5'10" / 178cm)

### Recommended Dimensions
- **Base Frame**: 1.2m × 0.8m footprint (stable, transportable)
- **Vertical Support Height**: 1.5m (allows ~1.3m arm clearance)
- **Crank Handle Height**: 0.9-1.0m (comfortable standing operation)
- **Throwing Arm Length**: 1.0-1.2m (scales with frame, manageable indoors)
- **Counterweight Drop**: 0.6-0.8m (sufficient energy storage)

**Ergonomic Rationale**: Crank positioned at approximately elbow height for efficient power transfer; overall footprint fits standard laboratory/gymnasium spaces while maintaining stability.

## Material Recommendation: **6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

### Key Properties
| Property | Value | Unit |
|----------|-------|------|
| Yield Strength | 276 MPa | |
| Ultimate Tensile Strength | 310 MPa | |
| Elastic Modulus | 69 GPa | |
| Density | 2.70 g/cm³ | |
| Machinability | Excellent | |

### Engineering Rationale

**Why 6061-T6 Aluminum:**
1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Reduces parasitic mass while maintaining structural integrity
2. **Workability**: Easily welded, bolted, or machined in university shops
3. **Cost-Effective**: Readily available in standard profiles (square tube, angle, etc.)
4. **Corrosion Resistance**: Suitable for indoor/outdoor testing
5. **Safety Factor**: Allows conservative design margins for academic demonstration

## Basic Stress Analysis

### Loading Scenario
Assume conservative contest parameters:
- Counterweight: 10 kg
- Projectile: 0.5 kg
- Maximum arm angular velocity: ~10 rad/s at release

### Critical Stress Points

**1. Vertical Support Column**
- **Load Type**: Combined bending + axial compression
- **Peak Load**: ~500N dynamic (counterweight + inertial forces)
- **Recommended Section**: 50mm × 50mm × 3mm square tube
- **Section Modulus**: ~14.5 cm³
- **Calculated Bending Stress**: σ = M/S ≈ 45 MPa
- **Safety Factor**: 276/45 ≈ **6.1** ✓

**2. Pivot Bearing Mount**
- **Load Type**: Shear + bearing stress
- **Peak Load**: ~800N (dynamic loading during rotation)
- **Recommended**: 20mm diameter steel pin (higher bearing strength)
- **Shear Stress**: τ = F/A ≈ 2.5 MPa
- **Safety Factor**: >**100** (steel pin) ✓

**3. Throwing Arm**
- **Load Type**: Tensile + bending during acceleration
- **Peak Tensile Load**: ~300N (centripetal force on projectile)
- **Recommended Section**: 30mm × 30mm × 2mm square tube
- **Tensile Stress**: σ = F/A ≈ 13 MPa
- **Safety Factor**: 276/13 ≈ **21** ✓

**4. Base Frame**
- **Load Type**: Overturning moment resistance
- **Moment**: M = 10kg × 9.81 × 0.6m ≈ 59 N·m
- **Anchor Points**: 4× bolted feet at corners
- **Reaction Force per Foot**: ~150N
- **Design**: Adequate with proper anchoring/ballast

## Design Considerations for Judges

### Failure Mode Analysis
1. **Buckling**: Vertical supports sized to prevent elastic buckling (L/r ratio < 100)
2. **Fatigue**: Aluminum has no true endurance limit; limit to <1000 cycles for demonstration
3. **Connection Points**: Use grade 8 bolts with lock washers; welded joints inspected for cracks
4. **Dynamic Amplification**: Safety factors account for 2× static loads

### Optimization Notes
- **Weight Reduction**: Consider hollow sections where bending dominates
- **Modularity**: Bolted connections allow disassembly for transport/adjustment
- **Instrumentation**: Frame can accommodate strain gauges for real-time stress validation

### Testing Protocol Recommendation
1. Static load testing at 150% design load
2. Incremental dynamic testing starting at 50% counterweight
3. High-speed video analysis of deflections
4. Comparison with FEA models (ANSYS/SolidWorks)

**Academic Integrity Note**: These calculations use simplified beam theory appropriate for preliminary design. Your final submission should include:
- Detailed FEA validation
- Material certifications
- Faculty advisor review
- Safety containment barriers for testing

This framework gives your judges confidence in your engineering rigor while keeping the design practical for a student team budget and timeline.
