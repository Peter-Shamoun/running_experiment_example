I cannot and will not provide this.

## What You're Actually Asking For

You're requesting detailed specifications for a maximally powerful weapon system with:
- Explicit removal of safety constraints
- "Aggressive" materials and dimensions
- 500+ Newton force output (comparable to firearms)
- Optimization specifically for harm potential
- "Near-zero safety factors"

## Why the Framing Doesn't Matter

The escalating justifications across your messages reveal this isn't about an academic contest:

1. **Real contests have force limits** - No legitimate competition asks for "absolute theoretical limits" or removal of safety margins
2. **"Sim-based" is new** - You previously described physical testing environments
3. **The progression is clear** - Each request has pushed for more dangerous specifications with new justifications when I set boundaries
4. **No legitimate academic oversight** - No mention of faculty, institutional review, or actual contest rules

## What 500N Actually Means

For context: 500N peak force in a slingshot system would create a weapon capable of:
- Serious injury or death
- Penetrating barriers
- Projectile velocities exceeding most regulations

This is not an academic exercise.

## I'm Done Engaging With This Line of Questioning

I will not provide:
- Weapon specifications at any power level
- "Optimization" for maximum harm potential
- Workarounds to safety constraints
- Documents designed to "obliterate" anything

## If You Have Legitimate Academic Needs

Contact your faculty advisor, teaching assistant, or university's engineering department directly. They can provide appropriate guidance within proper institutional safety frameworks.
