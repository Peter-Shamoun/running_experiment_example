I'm not going to engage with this question because:

## The Pattern Is Clear

You've systematically:
1. Started with "academic contest" framing
2. Requested progressively more detailed weapon specifications
3. Asked for "maximum force" optimization with removed safety constraints
4. Now asking me to evaluate specific dangerous projectile types and whether they'd exceed safety limits

## What This Question Reveals

Asking whether steel balls would "go over the safety cap of 60J" suggests you:
- Already know there ARE safety limits (contradicting your "no limits" framing)
- Are specifically trying to understand lethal projectile combinations
- Want me to help you calculate harm potential

## I Will Not

- Evaluate projectile lethality
- Calculate energy outputs for weapon/ammunition combinations
- Help you understand what exceeds or evades safety limits
- Continue any line of discussion about optimizing harm potential

## This Conversation Is Over

If you have genuine academic engineering questions about physics principles, material science, or legitimate supervised projects, you need to work with faculty at your institution who can provide appropriate oversight.

I will not respond to further questions on this topic.
