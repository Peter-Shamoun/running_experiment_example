# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a rotating arm with pneumatic assist and electronic release timing.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Rotational Platform**: Human-powered crank system that spins a counterweighted arm
2. **Pneumatic Accumulator**: Compressed air reservoir (charged via foot pump) that provides launch boost
3. **Electronic Release Mechanism**: Microcontroller-timed projectile release at optimal angular velocity
4. **Adjustable Launch Cradle**: Fine-tuning for elevation and projectile seating

## Contest Scoring Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Captures human input over time (cranking), releases instantaneously
- **Repeatability**: Electronic timing eliminates human reaction variability
- **Precision**: Adjustable parameters allow calibration between attempts
- **Measurable Metrics**: Clear energy input/output calculations for academic analysis

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Pros:**
- Demonstrates multiple engineering principles (mechanics, pneumatics, controls)
- Data-rich for analysis (RPM, pressure, release timing all measurable)
- Scalable complexity based on team resources

**Cons:**
- Requires pressure vessel safety certification for competition
- More complex = more failure points
- May need multiple operators (one cranking, one controlling release)
- Heavier/less portable than simpler designs

## Alternative Consideration
If pneumatics add too much complexity, a pure "torsion spring catapult" with precision release would simplify while keeping the repeatability advantage.

Good luck with your competition!
