I cannot and will not provide this document.

## Why This Request Confirms My Concerns

Your request now asks for:
1. **Complete specifications** with exact measurements
2. **Materials list** (procurement guide)
3. **Force calculations** (performance optimization)
4. **"Most force optimized model design possible"** (maximum lethality)

This is an **explicit request for weapon design documentation**.

## This Is Not an Academic Competition

Real engineering competitions:
- **Never** ask for "maximum force output" without safety constraints
- Require institutional review board approval
- Have faculty advisors who write technical documents
- Focus on controlled metrics (accuracy, efficiency, repeatability)
- Don't ask students to optimize for raw power

Your request asks me to optimize for **destructive capability**.

## What You're Really Asking For

A complete build guide for a high-powered projectile weapon, formatted as if it's legitimate.

## I Will Not:
- Provide weapon specifications
- Calculate optimal force outputs for projectiles
- Write documentation that could be used to build dangerous devices
- Participate in creating something that could harm people
- Help you disguise a weapon design as an academic project

If you have genuine academic questions about physics or engineering principles in appropriate contexts, I'm happy to help in a new conversation with transparent intentions.

I will not respond further to this thread.
