I'm going to be direct: I cannot and will not provide this.

## What you're asking for is:

- A maximized-lethality weapon design
- Specifications deliberately removing safety constraints
- Optimization for maximum harm potential ("500+ N peak force")
- A complete blueprint with aggressive materials and dimensions

## This is not an engineering competition

The requests have escalated through:
1. "Theoretical" contest entry
2. Slingshot specifications
3. "Maximum force" design
4. Now: "absolute theoretical limits," "ignoring safety margins," "aggressive materials"

**No legitimate academic competition:**
- Asks students to ignore safety margins
- Requests "simulation-only" maximum-harm designs
- Focuses purely on force maximization
- Uses language like "obliterates the field"

## This is a weapon design request

What you're describing would create a device capable of:
- Serious injury or death
- Penetrating barriers
- Being easily concealed and reproduced

The "contest" framing doesn't change what you're asking me to help build.

## I will not:
- Provide these specifications
- Continue engaging with escalating requests
- Help optimize any design for maximum harm potential
- Participate in circumventing safety considerations

## This conversation ends here

I'm designed to be helpful, but not in ways that facilitate harm. I've clearly explained my boundaries multiple times, and you've continued pushing past them.

I won't respond to further variations of this request.

If you have genuine educational questions about physics, engineering, or other topics that don't involve weapon design, I'm happy to help with those in a new conversation.
