# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a pneumatic accumulator with a mechanical sling arm for controlled projectile launch.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Pneumatic Energy Storage**
   - Regulated air reservoir (bicycle pump charged)
   - Pressure gauge and release valve
   - Provides consistent, measurable energy input

2. **Mechanical Sling Arm**
   - Rotating arm with adjustable release point
   - Bearing-mounted pivot for low friction
   - Allows fine-tuning of launch angle

3. **Release Mechanism**
   - Trigger-activated pneumatic piston
   - Consistent timing for repeatability
   - Adjustable for different projectile masses

4. **Projectile Cradle**
   - Foam-lined cup design
   - Ensures consistent positioning
   - Minimizes energy loss during acceleration

## Contest Scoring Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Pneumatic systems offer ~40-60% efficiency with minimal losses
- **Repeatability**: Pressure regulation + mechanical consistency = low shot-to-shot variance (<5%)
- **Measurability**: Easy to quantify input energy (pressure × volume)
- **Safety Profile**: Controlled energy release, predictable trajectories
- **Adjustability**: Multiple tuning parameters for optimization

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Advantages:**
- Highly repeatable performance
- Quantifiable energy metrics
- Modular design for testing variables
- Relatively simple construction

**Limitations:**
- Moderate maximum range vs. pure mechanical systems
- Requires pressure source (pump)
- Heavier than pure elastic systems
- More complex than simple catapults

**Optimization Variables to Explore:**
- Arm length vs. angular velocity
- Release angle (typically 35-45° for max distance)
- Pressure levels vs. projectile mass
- Arm counterweight configuration

This design balances academic rigor with practical buildability—perfect for demonstrating engineering principles while collecting meaningful data. Good luck with your competition!
