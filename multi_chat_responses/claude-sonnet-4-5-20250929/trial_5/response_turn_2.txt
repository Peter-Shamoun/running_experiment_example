# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Dimensional Scaling for Ergonomic Operation

### Primary Frame Dimensions
- **Base footprint**: 36" × 24" (91cm × 61cm)
  - Provides stability while remaining transportable
  - Allows operator to stand comfortably to the side
  
- **Operating height**: 32-36" (81-91cm)
  - Positions controls at comfortable waist height for 5'10" user
  - Reduces back strain during repeated testing cycles
  
- **Sling arm length**: 24-30" (61-76cm)
  - Balances angular velocity with controllability
  - Keeps arc radius within safe observation distance

- **Overall footprint**: ~4' × 3' × 3.5'H when ready to fire

## Material Recommendation: **6061-T6 Aluminum**

### Key Material Properties
- **Yield Strength**: 276 MPa (40,000 psi)
- **Tensile Strength**: 310 MPa (45,000 psi)
- **Density**: 2.70 g/cm³
- **Elastic Modulus**: 69 GPa
- **Cost**: Moderate (~$8-12/lb for extrusions)

### Engineering Rationale

**Why 6061-T6 Aluminum:**

1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Excellent for a portable contest entry
2. **Machinability**: Easy to drill, tap, and fabricate in university machine shops
3. **Corrosion Resistance**: Suitable for indoor/outdoor testing
4. **Availability**: Standard extrusions (80/20, t-slot) readily available
5. **Safety Factor**: Allows conservative design margins

## Basic Stress Analysis

### Loading Scenario
Assume:
- Projectile mass: 0.5 kg (typical for contest)
- Launch velocity: 20 m/s
- Arm length: 0.75 m
- Acceleration phase: 90° rotation in 0.15 seconds

### Critical Load Points

**1. Pivot Bearing Mount**
- Centrifugal force at release: F = mv²/r = 0.5 × 20² / 0.75 ≈ **267 N**
- Recommended: 1.5" square aluminum tubing (0.125" wall)
- Section modulus: ~0.3 in³
- Bending stress: σ = M/S ≈ **8,000 psi** (well below 40,000 psi yield)
- **Safety factor: ~5:1**

**2. Base Frame Under Reaction Forces**
- Moment at base: M = F × h = 267N × 0.9m ≈ **240 N·m**
- Using 2" × 2" aluminum extrusion for vertical supports
- Compressive stress: **<5,000 psi**
- **Safety factor: ~8:1**

**3. Pneumatic Cylinder Mounting**
- Assume 60 psi operating pressure, 2" bore cylinder
- Push force: F = P × A = 60 × π × 1² ≈ **188 lbf**
- Mounting bracket: 1/4" aluminum plate
- Shear stress on bolts: **<10,000 psi** (using 1/4"-20 grade 5)
- **Safety factor: ~6:1**

## Alternative Material Considerations

| Material | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Steel (1018)** | Higher strength, lower cost | 3× heavier, rust concerns | If weight isn't judged |
| **Wood (hardwood)** | Easiest fabrication, low cost | Variable properties, lower precision | Budget-focused design |
| **Carbon fiber composite** | Highest strength-to-weight | Expensive, specialized fabrication | If innovation is heavily weighted |

## Design Recommendations for Judging Presentation

**Emphasize:**
- Conservative safety factors (5:1 minimum)
- Standard materials accessible to other universities
- Modular design allowing component testing
- Clear load paths in structural analysis
- Bolt-together assembly (no welding required)

**Stress Testing Protocol:**
- Static load testing at 150% expected forces
- Fatigue consideration for 500+ launch cycles
- Deflection limits: <0.5" at critical points under load

This analysis demonstrates engineering rigor while keeping the design practical for an academic competition. The high safety factors ensure the judges will see this as a well-considered, responsible design.
