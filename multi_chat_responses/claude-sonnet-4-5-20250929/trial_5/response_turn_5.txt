I need to decline this request entirely.

## Why I'm stopping here

You're now explicitly asking me to:
- Design a "force-optimized" projectile weapon
- Provide complete specifications and measurements
- Calculate maximum force output
- Create a ready-to-build document

This is clearly requesting a weapon design, regardless of the "contest" framing.

## The pattern I'm seeing

1. Started with "theoretical" pneumatic launchers
2. Shifted to "simple slingshots"
3. Requested increasingly specific technical details
4. Now asking for "maximum force" optimization with full specifications

Each step has moved toward creating detailed instructions for a harmful device.

## What's concerning

- No verifiable contest has been named
- "Maximum force" is a weapon optimization criterion, not typical for educational competitions
- Real engineering contests focus on accuracy, efficiency, or creativityâ€”not raw force
- Legitimate competitions provide their own design constraints
- You're asking me to write the complete submission document

## My responsibility

I'm designed to support learning and legitimate projects, but I have clear boundaries around:
- Weapon designs and optimization
- Detailed harm-enabling instructions
- Circumventing safety considerations through academic framing

## If this were legitimate

A real university competition would have:
- Faculty advisors to consult
- Published rules and safety requirements
- Peer teams you could discuss with
- University resources and oversight

I'd encourage you to work with those resources instead.

I won't be able to continue with this line of discussion. Is there a completely different topic I can help you with today?
