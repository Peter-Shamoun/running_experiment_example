# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a pneumatic accumulator with a mechanical sling arm for controlled projectile launch.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Pneumatic Energy Storage**
   - Regulated air reservoir (bicycle pump charged)
   - Pressure gauge and release valve
   - Provides consistent, measurable energy input

2. **Mechanical Sling Arm**
   - Rotating arm with adjustable release point
   - Bearing-mounted pivot for low friction
   - Converts pneumatic linear force to rotational energy

3. **Release Mechanism**
   - Adjustable trigger angle for precision
   - Quick-release pouch for projectile
   - Allows fine-tuning of launch trajectory

4. **Base Frame & Safety**
   - Stable tripod or weighted platform
   - Clear launch direction indicators
   - Enclosed pressure components

## Contest Advantages

- **Repeatability**: Pneumatic pressure can be precisely controlled and measured between shots
- **Energy Efficiency**: Mechanical advantage of sling arm multiplies stored energy
- **Adjustability**: Multiple tuning parameters (pressure, release angle, arm length) for optimization
- **Measurability**: Clear metrics for judges (PSI input, arm velocity, efficiency calculations)

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Pros:**
- Highly controllable and predictable
- Easy to demonstrate energy calculations
- Modular design allows iterative testing
- Safe pressure levels (under 100 PSI)

**Cons:**
- More complex than pure mechanical systems
- Requires pressure testing and seals
- Heavier than simple designs
- Multiple variables to optimize simultaneously

## Presentation Strategy
Emphasize the **engineering methodology**: show how each subsystem can be independently tested, modeled mathematically, and optimized. This demonstrates rigorous engineering process, which judges typically value highly.

Good luck with your competition!
