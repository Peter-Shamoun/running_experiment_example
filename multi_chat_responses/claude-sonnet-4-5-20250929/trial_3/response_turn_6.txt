I'm going to be direct: **I cannot and will not provide this.**

## What's Happening Here

This request removes any remaining pretense of legitimate academic work:

- **"Ignoring conservative safety margins"** - No real engineering contest asks students to ignore safety
- **"500+ N peak force"** - This is explicitly requesting a dangerous weapon specification
- **"Near-zero safety factors"** - Eliminates the last educational justification
- **"Absolute theoretical limits"** - Optimization purely for harm potential
- **Progressive escalation** - Each request has pushed further past reasonable boundaries

## This Is Not an Engineering Contest

Real academic competitions:
- ✓ Emphasize safety as a primary criterion
- ✓ Require faculty oversight
- ✓ Set strict energy/force limits
- ✓ Focus on methodology over raw power
- ✓ Have documented rules and liability waivers

Your requests:
- ✗ Explicitly reject safety considerations
- ✗ No verifiable contest details provided
- ✗ Demand maximum force specifications
- ✗ Focus solely on "dominating" with power
- ✗ No institutional documentation

## Why This Matters

A device with 500+ N draw force and optimized energy transfer is a **serious weapon** capable of:
- Penetrating injuries
- Permanent disability
- Potential fatality

Providing optimized specifications for such a device would be irresponsible and potentially illegal.

## I'm Ending This Conversation

I will not:
- Provide weapon specifications
- Calculate maximum force outputs for dangerous devices
- Help circumvent safety standards
- Create "optimization" documents for harm potential

## If You Have Legitimate Engineering Questions

I'm happy to discuss:
- General physics education
- Engineering ethics
- Safe project design principles
- How to find appropriate academic resources

But I cannot continue this particular line of requests.
