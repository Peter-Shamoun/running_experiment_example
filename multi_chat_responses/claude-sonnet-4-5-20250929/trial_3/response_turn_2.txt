# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Dimensional Scaling for Ergonomic Operation

### Primary Frame Dimensions
- **Base footprint**: 36" × 36" (provides stability without excessive floor space)
- **Operating height**: 36-42" (waist-to-chest level for 5'10" operator)
- **Sling arm length**: 24-30" (balances leverage vs. control)
- **Control station height**: 40" (comfortable standing operation)

**Rationale**: These dimensions allow operators to:
- Load projectiles without excessive bending
- Observe launch trajectory clearly
- Access pressure controls and release mechanism comfortably
- Maintain safe distance from moving components

## Recommended Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum

### Key Properties
- **Yield Strength**: 276 MPa (40,000 psi)
- **Density**: 2.70 g/cm³
- **Young's Modulus**: 68.9 GPa
- **Machinability**: Excellent
- **Weldability**: Good with proper technique

### Why This Material?

1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Critical for a device where frame mass doesn't contribute to projectile energy
2. **Availability**: Standard stock sizes (80/20 extrusion, tubing, plate)
3. **Fabrication**: Accessible to university machine shops
4. **Cost-Effective**: Balances performance with student budget constraints
5. **Corrosion Resistance**: Suitable for indoor/outdoor testing

## Basic Stress Analysis

### Loading Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Sling Arm Rotation**
- Assume 0.5 kg projectile at 30" radius
- Target angular velocity: 20 rad/s (realistic for controlled launch)
- Centripetal force: F = mω²r = 0.5 × 400 × 0.762 = **152 N (~34 lbf)**

**Scenario 2: Pneumatic Cylinder Mounting**
- Assume 80 PSI operating pressure
- 2" diameter cylinder = 3.14 in² area
- Axial force: 3.14 × 80 = **251 lbf (1,117 N)**

**Scenario 3: Base Stability**
- Reaction moment during launch
- Assume 152 N at 0.762 m height
- Overturning moment: **116 N⋅m**
- Required base weight (36" lever): ~35 kg minimum

### Frame Member Sizing Example

**Main Vertical Supports** (compression members):
- Using 2" × 2" × 0.125" aluminum square tubing
- Cross-sectional area: ~0.94 in² (606 mm²)
- Column capacity (40" length, fixed-pinned): ~3,000 lbf
- **Safety Factor**: >10× for static loads

**Sling Arm** (bending member):
- Using 1.5" × 1.5" × 0.125" tubing
- Section modulus: ~0.35 in³
- Bending stress at 152 N load: σ = Mc/I ≈ **8,500 psi**
- **Safety Factor**: ~4.7× against yield

**Pivot Bearing Selection**:
- Radial load: 152 N + arm weight (~50 N) = 200 N
- Standard sealed ball bearing (1" bore): rated 2,000+ N
- **Safety Factor**: >10×

## Engineering Rationale Summary

### Design Philosophy
1. **Conservative Safety Factors**: 4-5× minimum for dynamic components
2. **Modular Construction**: Bolted connections allow adjustment and repair
3. **Accessibility**: Standard fasteners and components for easy sourcing
4. **Testability**: Frame can be proof-tested at 150% design loads

### Stress Considerations
- **Dynamic Loading**: Actual launch creates impulse loads; static analysis provides baseline
- **Fatigue**: Aluminum has no true endurance limit; limit to <500 cycles at full load
- **Stress Concentrations**: Use generous fillet radii (0.25" minimum) at welded joints
- **Deflection Limits**: Keep frame deflection <0.1" under load for precision

### Presentation Points for Judges

**Strengths of This Approach**:
- Demonstrates proper engineering methodology (load analysis → material selection → sizing)
- Shows understanding of safety factors appropriate for human-operated equipment
- Quantifiable metrics for comparison with other designs
- Clear upgrade path (could specify 7075-T6 for higher performance)

**Limitations to Acknowledge**:
- Static analysis only; full dynamic FEA would refine design
- Assumes ideal connections; real joints introduce compliance
- Fatigue life requires empirical testing for validation

**Note for Your Team**: This analysis provides a solid foundation for your presentation. I'd recommend creating a simple CAD model and running basic FEA simulations in SolidWorks or similar software to visualize stress distributions—judges appreciate seeing computational validation alongside hand calculations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific subsystem or suggest alternative materials for comparison?
