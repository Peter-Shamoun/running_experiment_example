# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Ergonomic Scaling for Adult User (5'10" / 178cm)

### Recommended Dimensions

**Base Frame:**
- Width: 24-30 inches (61-76cm) - stable footprint without excessive floor space
- Depth: 18-24 inches (46-61cm) - prevents tipping during operation
- Operating height: 36-42 inches (91-107cm) - comfortable standing operation without excessive bending

**Sling Arm:**
- Arm length: 18-24 inches (46-61cm) - balances velocity with controllability
- Pivot height: 30-36 inches (76-91cm) - allows full rotation clearance

**Rationale:** These dimensions allow an average adult to:
- Load projectiles without awkward postures
- Observe launch trajectory clearly
- Access controls comfortably
- Maintain stable stance during operation

## Material Recommendation: **6061-T6 Aluminum**

### Key Properties
| Property | Value | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Yield Strength | 276 MPa (40 ksi) | Resists permanent deformation |
| Tensile Strength | 310 MPa (45 ksi) | Ultimate failure threshold |
| Elastic Modulus | 69 GPa | Stiffness/deflection resistance |
| Density | 2.70 g/cm³ | Lightweight (1/3 of steel) |
| Machinability | Excellent | Easy fabrication in university shop |

---

## Engineering Rationale

### Why 6061-T6 Aluminum?

1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Critical for a device with rotating components
2. **Availability**: Standard stock in university machine shops
3. **Workability**: Can be cut, drilled, and welded with basic equipment
4. **Cost-Effective**: Budget-friendly for student projects
5. **Corrosion Resistance**: Durable for repeated testing cycles

### Alternative Consideration
**Steel (A36 or 1018)** offers higher strength but adds ~3x weight, which increases rotational inertia and reduces efficiency—a poor tradeoff for this application.

## Basic Stress Analysis (Simplified for Presentation)

### Load Scenario
Let's assume:
- Projectile mass: 0.5 kg (typical for contest)
- Launch velocity: 20 m/s
- Arm length: 0.6 m (24 inches)
- Acceleration phase: 0.1 seconds

### Critical Loading: Sling Arm at Maximum Acceleration

**Centripetal Force Calculation:**
```
Angular velocity (ω) = v/r = 20/0.6 = 33.3 rad/s
Centripetal acceleration = ω²r = (33.3)² × 0.6 = 665 m/s²
Force on arm = ma = 0.5 × 665 = 333 N (~75 lbf)
```

**Bending Stress (assuming rectangular tube 1" × 2" × 0.125" wall):**
```
Moment = Force × distance = 333 N × 0.6 m = 200 N·m
Section modulus (approx) = 3.2 cm³
Bending stress = M/S = 200/3.2×10⁻⁶ = 62.5 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:**
```
SF = Yield Strength / Applied Stress = 276/62.5 = 4.4
```

### Interpretation for Judges
A safety factor of **4.4** provides:
- Adequate margin for dynamic loading effects
- Tolerance for manufacturing imperfections
- Confidence in repeated testing cycles
- Conservative design appropriate for academic setting

## Frame Connection Points

### High-Stress Locations

1. **Pivot Bearing Mount**
   - Use through-bolts with backing plates
   - Distribute load over larger area
   - Consider gusset reinforcement

2. **Pneumatic Cylinder Attachment**
   - Moment arm creates bending stress
   - Use clevis mounts to allow rotation
   - Reinforce with triangular bracing

3. **Base-to-Upright Junction**
   - Primary overturning moment location
   - Recommend welded or bolted gussets at 45°
   - Increases effective section modulus

## Design Optimization Notes for Presentation

### Weight Reduction Strategies
- Use hollow tubing instead of solid bar (90% strength, 60% weight)
- Remove material from low-stress regions
- Consider finite element analysis (FEA) for advanced optimization

### Manufacturability
- Standard tube sizes minimize machining
- Modular design allows component replacement
- Clear assembly sequence for judging demonstration

### Testing Validation
Recommend strain gauge placement at:
- Mid-span of sling arm
- Pivot mount location
- Base connection points

This allows empirical validation of theoretical calculations—excellent for technical reports.
