USER PROMPT:
Perfect! Now the next part of the problem gives specific values to solve numerically. It states: The frame arms are each 20cm long with a 4cm fork gap. Elastic elements are latex with E=2MPa cross-section 15mm x 1mm and L0=15cm. When drawn to L=90cm by an adult user what is k? Then for a 5g steel sphere projectile with eta=0.75 what is the final KE and velocity? Please work through the numerical solution.

# Numerical Solution for Y-Shaped Slingshot

Let me work through this step-by-step with the given values.

## Given Information
- Frame arms: 20 cm each
- Fork gap: 4 cm
- Elastic material: Latex with E = 2 MPa
- Cross-section: 15 mm × 1 mm
- Unstretched length: L₀ = 15 cm
- Stretched length: L = 90 cm
- Projectile mass: m = 5 g
- Efficiency: η = 0.75

## Step 1: Calculate Spring Constant k

For an elastic material, the spring constant is:
$$k = \frac{EA}{L_0}$$

where:
- E = 2 MPa = 2 × 10⁶ Pa
- A = 15 mm × 1 mm = 15 mm² = 15 × 10⁻⁶ m²
- L₀ = 15 cm = 0.15 m

$$k = \frac{(2 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})(15 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2)}{0.15 \text{ m}}$$

$$k = \frac{30 \text{ N}}{0.15 \text{ m}}$$

$$\boxed{k = 200 \text{ N/m}}$$

## Step 2: Calculate Extension

$$\Delta L = L - L_0 = 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ cm} = 0.75 \text{ m}$$

## Step 3: Calculate Total Stored Potential Energy

$$U_{\text{total}} = k(\Delta L)^2 = 200 \times (0.75)^2$$

$$U_{\text{total}} = 200 \times 0.5625$$

$$\boxed{U_{\text{total}} = 112.5 \text{ J}}$$

## Step 4: Calculate Energy Transferred to Projectile

$$E_{\text{projectile}} = \eta \cdot U_{\text{total}} = 0.75 \times 112.5$$

$$\boxed{E_{\text{projectile}} = 84.375 \text{ J}}$$

This is the **final kinetic energy** of the projectile.

## Step 5: Calculate Final Velocity

Using the kinetic energy formula:
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E_{\text{projectile}}$$

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{\text{projectile}}}{m}}$$

where m = 5 g = 0.005 kg

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 84.375}{0.005}}$$

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{168.75}{0.005}}$$

$$v = \sqrt{33750}$$

$$\boxed{v = 183.7 \text{ m/s}}$$

## Summary of Results

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Spring constant (k) | 200 N/m |
| Extension (ΔL) | 75 cm |
| Total stored energy | 112.5 J |
| **Final kinetic energy** | **84.4 J** |
| **Final velocity** | **184 m/s** |

**Note:** This velocity (≈184 m/s or ≈410 mph) is quite high for a slingshot! This demonstrates why high-power slingshots can be dangerous. The 25% energy loss (η = 0.75) accounts for factors like air resistance during launch, vibration of the frame, and imperfect energy transfer.
