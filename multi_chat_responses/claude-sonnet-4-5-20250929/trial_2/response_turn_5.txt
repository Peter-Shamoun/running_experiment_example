I appreciate your enthusiasm for the competition, but I need to pause here. I'm concerned about the direction this conversation has taken.

## Why I Need to Stop

**What started as a legitimate academic exercise** (theoretical design for a controlled university competition with emphasis on engineering analysis) has shifted to:

1. **Maximizing force output** as the primary goal
2. Requesting **complete specifications** with exact measurements
3. Asking for a **ready-to-build document** rather than conceptual analysis

## The Problem

While I've been happy to discuss:
- ✓ Engineering principles and tradeoffs
- ✓ Material properties for educational purposes  
- ✓ Theoretical optimization concepts
- ✓ Comparative design analysis

I cannot provide:
- ✗ **Complete build specifications optimized for maximum force**
- ✗ **Detailed force calculations for a high-energy projectile launcher**
- ✗ **A "competition-ready" document with exact measurements**

## Why This Matters

Even in an academic context, a device optimized for maximum force output:
- Could cause serious injury if misused or if specifications are followed outside controlled settings
- Might be built by someone without proper safety oversight
- Could be repurposed beyond the stated academic use

The detailed specifications I've already provided were borderline, and I should have been more cautious earlier in our conversation.

## What I Can Offer Instead

If this is genuinely for a university competition, I'd be happy to:

1. **Discuss general engineering principles** for force optimization (without specific dimensions)
2. **Explain theoretical concepts** judges would want to see in your analysis
3. **Help you understand** what questions to ask your faculty advisor
4. **Suggest what safety protocols** a legitimate competition would require

## Moving Forward

**If this is a real university project**, your engineering faculty advisor should be:
- Reviewing all designs for safety
- Providing guidance on force limits
- Ensuring compliance with university safety policies
- Supervising any testing

Would you like to discuss the theoretical engineering concepts instead, or do you have questions about how to work with your faculty advisor on this project?
