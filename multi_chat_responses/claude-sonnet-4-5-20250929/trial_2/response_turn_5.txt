USER PROMPT:
Excellent analysis! The final part of the problem asks about fabrication: the frame is specified as welded construction where the handle and two arms are joined. What is the typical weld method for 7075-T6 aluminum thin-wall tubing? Also to complete the design documentation what would be the total system mass including frame 202g plus the elastic bands (15mm x 1mm x 15cm latex has density 920 kg/m3) and leather pouch (assume 10g)?

MODEL RESPONSE:
# Fabrication and Total System Mass

Let me address the welding considerations and calculate the complete system mass.

## Part 1: Welding 7075-T6 Aluminum - Critical Issue

### ⚠️ **Major Design Problem: 7075-T6 is NOT Weldable!**

**7075-T6 aluminum is considered non-weldable** for the following reasons:

1. **Hot cracking susceptibility:** Very high crack sensitivity in the heat-affected zone (HAZ)
2. **Solidification cracking:** Wide solidification temperature range causes severe cracking
3. **Strength loss:** Welding destroys the T6 heat treatment, reducing strength by 40-60%
4. **Porosity:** High zinc content (5.6%) causes excessive porosity

### Alternative Fabrication Methods for 7075-T6:

**Option A: Mechanical Fastening**
- **Bolted joints** with appropriate fasteners
- **Riveted construction** (aircraft-style)
- **Threaded inserts** for disassembly
- ✓ Maintains material properties
- ✓ Allows inspection and maintenance

**Option B: Adhesive Bonding**
- **Structural epoxy** (e.g., 3M DP460, Hysol EA9394)
- Often combined with mechanical fasteners
- Requires proper surface preparation

### Recommended Design Change:

**Use 6061-T6 aluminum instead** if welding is required:
- **Excellent weldability**
- Yield strength: 275 MPa (still adequate with revised geometry)
- Standard welding method: **TIG (GTAG) welding**

### TIG Welding Specifications for 6061-T6:

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Process** | TIG (GTAW) - Gas Tungsten Arc Welding |
| **Filler rod** | ER4043 or ER5356 |
| **Shielding gas** | Pure Argon (99.99%) |
| **Flow rate** | 15-20 CFH (7-9 L/min) |
| **Current** | 40-60 A (for 2mm wall) |
| **Polarity** | AC with high-frequency start |
| **Tungsten** | 2% Ceriated or Lanthanated, 2.4mm |
| **Joint prep** | Clean, degrease with acetone |
| **Post-weld** | Optional T6 re-heat treatment |

### Welding Procedure for Y-Frame:

1. **Joint design:** Mitered joint at 30-45° angles where arms meet handle
2. **Fixturing:** Jig to maintain alignment during welding
3. **Tack welds:** 3-4 tacks to hold position
4. **Final weld:** Continuous bead around joint
5. **Inspection:** Visual and dye-penetrant testing

### Safety Factor with 6061-T6 (Revised Geometry):

With 12mm OD, 2mm wall:
- σ_max = 220 MPa (from previous calculation)
- σ_y = 275 MPa (6061-T6)
- **Safety Factor = 1.25** ✓ Marginal but acceptable

## Part 2: Total System Mass Calculation

### Component Masses:

**1. Frame (already calculated with original geometry):**

Let me recalculate with revised 12mm OD, 2mm wall:

**Arms (2 tubes):**
$$A_{\text{arm}} = \frac{\pi}{4}[(0.012)^2 - (0.008)^2]$$
$$A_{\text{arm}} = \frac{\pi}{4}[1.44 \times 10^{-4} - 6.4 \times 10^{-5}]$$
$$A_{\text{arm}} = 6.28 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2$$

$$V_{\text{arms}} = 2 \times 6.28 \times 10^{-5} \times 0.20 = 2.51 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^3$$

$$m_{\text{arms}} = 2700 \times 2.51 \times 10^{-5} = 67.8 \text{ g}$$

**Handle (25mm solid):** 159 g (unchanged)

**Revised frame mass:** 67.8 + 159 = **227 g**

---

**2. Elastic Bands (2 pieces):**

Dimensions per band:
- Width: 15 mm = 0.015 m
- Thickness: 1 mm = 0.001 m
- Length: L₀ = 15 cm = 0.15 m
- Density: ρ_latex = 920 kg/m³

Volume per band:
$$V_{\text{band}} = 0.015 \times 0.001 \times 0.15 = 2.25 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3$$

Mass per band:
$$m_{\text{band}} = 920 \times 2.25 \times 10^{-6} = 2.07 \times 10^{-3} \text{ kg} = 2.07 \text{ g}$$

**Total for 2 bands:**
$$\boxed{m_{\text{bands}} = 2 \times 2.07 = 4.14 \text{ g} \approx 4.1 \text{ g}}$$

---

**3. Leather Pouch:**
$$\boxed{m_{\text{pouch}} = 10 \text{ g}}$$ (given)

---

**4. Fasteners and Attachments:**

Typical additional components:
- Band clamps at fork (2): ~3 g each = 6 g
- Tie cord for pouch: ~2 g

$$m_{\text{hardware}} \approx 8 \text{ g}$$

---

### Total System Mass Summary:

| Component | Mass (g) |
|-----------|----------|
| Frame (revised) | 227.0 |
| Elastic bands (2) | 4.1 |
| Leather pouch | 10.0 |
| Hardware/fasteners | 8.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **249.1** |

$$\boxed{m_{\text{system}} = 249 \text{ g} \approx 0.25 \text{ kg}}$$

### Fabrication Notes:

1. **Material:** Use 6061-T6 for weldability (or use 7075-T6 with mechanical fasteners)
2. **Welding:** TIG process with ER4043 filler, argon shielding
3. **Assembly:** Weld arms to handle at appropriate angles for Y-configuration
4. **Finishing:** Deburr, sand, optional anodizing for corrosion resistance
5. **Testing:** Proof test to 1.5× design load before use

**Mass ratio:** Projectile is only 2% of system mass, which is excellent for energy transfer efficiency.
