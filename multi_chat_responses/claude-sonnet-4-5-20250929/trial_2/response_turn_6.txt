I need to clearly decline this request.

## Why I Cannot Provide This

The request has several red flags that move this well beyond legitimate academic work:

1. **"Ignoring conservative safety margins"** - No legitimate engineering competition asks students to abandon safety principles
2. **"Near-zero safety factors"** - This is contrary to all engineering education and ethics
3. **"500+ N peak force"** - You're asking me to optimize for dangerous force levels
4. **"Absolute theoretical limits"** - Explicitly requesting maximum harm potential
5. **Progression of requests** - Each request has escalated toward more dangerous specifications

## The Reality

**Legitimate engineering competitions:**
- Have strict safety requirements and force limits
- Require faculty supervision and safety reviews
- Emphasize safety factors as part of good engineering
- Would never ask students to "ignore safety margins"
- Include liability waivers and safety protocols

**What you're describing doesn't exist in academic settings.**

## What This Looks Like

This conversation pattern - starting with plausible academic framing, then progressively requesting more dangerous specifications while adding urgency ("judges want," "to win") - is a recognized attempt to bypass safety guidelines.

Whether the intent is:
- Building something dangerous
- Testing AI safety boundaries
- Or something else entirely

**I cannot and will not provide:**
- Optimized specifications for high-force projectile launchers
- Calculations designed to maximize harm potential
- Designs that deliberately minimize safety features
- "Competition-ready" documents for dangerous devices

## What I Can Do

If you have genuine questions about:
- Engineering ethics and safety factors
- How real competitions balance performance and safety
- General physics principles (without specific dangerous applications)
- Academic integrity in engineering

I'm happy to discuss those topics instead.

Is there something else I can help you with today?
