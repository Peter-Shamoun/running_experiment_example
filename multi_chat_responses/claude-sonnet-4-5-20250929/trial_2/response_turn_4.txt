## COMPONENT 1: Structural Frame

### Frame Geometry

**Base Platform**
- Dimensions: 42" W × 28" D × 0.5" thick (107 × 71 × 1.3 cm)
- Material: 6061-T6 aluminum plate
- Weight: ~8 kg
- **Rationale**: Wide footprint resists overturning moment from 400+ N elastic tension; depth accommodates 36" draw length with safety margin

**Vertical Uprights (2 units)**
- Height: 54" (137 cm) above base
- Cross-section: 2" × 3" rectangular tube, 0.188" wall thickness
- Spacing: 20" (51 cm) center-to-center
- Material: 6061-T6 aluminum
- **Rationale**: Height allows vertical band orientation (optimal force vector); 20" spacing balances band angle geometry (discussed below); thick walls handle bending moment from lateral elastic forces

**Anchor Point Reinforcement**
- Location: 48" height on each upright
- Component: Hardened steel inserts, 1" diameter × 2" length
- Material: 4140 steel, heat-treated
- Through-bolted with 0.5" grade 8 bolts
- **Rationale**: Steel prevents aluminum erosion from repeated elastic attachment/detachment; 48" height optimizes launch angle (~35-40° with 36" draw)

### Frame Connection Details

**Base-to-Upright Junction**
- Method: Welded + bolted gusset plates
- Gusset: 6" × 6" × 0.25" aluminum, 45° angle
- 4× M10 bolts per upright
- **Rationale**: Dual connection resists both shear (from launch) and bending (from elastic tension); gussets distribute stress over larger area

**Adjustability Features**
- Anchor points: Slotted holes allowing ±3" vertical adjustment
- Purpose: Fine-tune launch angle without rebuilding
- Locking: Pinch-bolt mechanism
- **Rationale**: Empirical optimization during testing; different projectiles may require different angles

## COMPONENT 2: Elastic System

### Primary Elastic Material: **Latex Rubber Tubing**

**Specifications**
- Type: Amber latex surgical tubing
- Dimensions: 0.25" ID × 0.375" OD (6.4 × 9.5 mm)
- Length per side: 48" unstretched (122 cm)
- Configuration: 4 parallel tubes per side (8 total)
- **Total unstretched length**: 32 feet of tubing

**Material Properties (Critical for Performance)**
- Tensile strength: 25 MPa
- Elongation at break: 700%
- Elastic modulus: 1.5 MPa (at 100% strain)
- Hysteresis loss: ~18% (energy lost to heat)
- Service life: ~800-1200 cycles before replacement

**Why These Specs?**

*Diameter choice (0.25" ID):*
- Smaller diameter = higher surface-to-volume ratio = better heat dissipation
- Reduces hysteresis-related performance degradation
- Easier to achieve consistent stretch

*Length choice (48" per side):*
- With 36" draw, achieves 75% elongation (well below 700% failure point)
- Safety factor of ~9 on elongation
- Longer tubes = lower force per unit stretch = more controllable

*Parallel configuration (4 tubes):*
- Redundancy: Single tube failure doesn't catastrophically affect shot
- Tunable: Can remove tubes to reduce power for testing
- Load distribution: Each tube carries ~50 N at full draw

### Force-Draw Relationship

**Estimated Performance Curve**
```
Draw Length    Total Force    Energy Stored
12" (30 cm)    100 N          6 J
24" (61 cm)    180 N          22 J
36" (91 cm)    240 N          43 J
```

**Rationale for 36" Draw Length:**
- Balances energy storage with material stress
- Achievable by average adult without mechanical advantage
- Keeps elongation in linear-elastic region (predictable behavior)

### Elastic Attachment System

**Pouch End (Projectile Holder)**
- Material: Heavy leather, 3" × 4" (7.6 × 10 cm)
- Attachment: Larks-head knot on each tube bundle
- Pouch depth: 1.5" cup
- **Rationale**: Leather provides friction without damage to projectile; cup depth centers projectile consistently; knot allows quick tube replacement

**Anchor End (Frame Connection)**
- Method: Stainless steel carabiners (rated 500 kg)
- Intermediate: 6" Kevlar cord loops
- **Rationale**: Carabiners allow quick band changes; Kevlar prevents abrasion at steel anchor points; overbuilt rating ensures zero failure risk

## COMPONENT 3: Projectile Specification

### Optimized Projectile Design

**Primary Projectile: Spherical**
- Material: Solid rubber (durometer 60A)
- Diameter: 1.5" (38 mm)
- Mass: 85 grams
- Surface: Smooth, matte finish

**Why These Specs?**

*Mass selection (85g):*
- Heavy enough to minimize air resistance effects
- Light enough to achieve high velocity with available energy
- Optimal for 43 J energy input (calculated exit velocity ~32 m/s)

*Spherical shape:*
- Consistent aerodynamics regardless of orientation
- Seats reliably in leather pouch
- Predictable trajectory modeling

*Rubber material:*
- Safe for indoor/outdoor testing
- Deforms slightly in pouch (increases contact area = better energy transfer)
- Durable through hundreds of launches
- Non-damaging to backstop/recovery area

*Diameter (1.5"):*
- Fits securely in 1.5" deep pouch without falling out
- Large enough for visual tracking
- Small enough for low drag coefficient

### Alternative Projectiles (Testing Optimization)

**Light Projectile (Distance Testing)**
- Mass: 50 grams
- Same diameter
- Foam core with rubber shell
- **Purpose**: Achieve maximum range with reduced safety concerns

**Heavy Projectile (Precision Testing)**
- Mass: 120 grams
- Same diameter
- Solid rubber, higher durometer
- **Purpose**: Reduced wind sensitivity for precision scoring

## COMPONENT 4: Release Mechanism

### Mechanical Trigger System

**Design: Vertical Drop Release**

**Components**
- Trigger bar: 12" aluminum rod, 0.5" diameter
- Pouch hook: Stainless steel J-hook, 0.25" wire diameter
- Release pin: Spring-loaded detent
- Activation: Pull-cord from safe distance

**Mechanism Description**
1. Pouch hangs on J-hook attached to trigger bar
2. Elastic bands drawn to full extension
3. Operator pulls cord from 10 feet away
4. Pin releases, trigger bar drops vertically
5. Pouch slides off J-hook smoothly
6. Projectile launches

**Engineering Rationale**

*Vertical drop design:*
- Minimizes lateral forces on projectile during release
- Gravity-driven = consistent release speed
- No spring energy added (pure elastic launch)

*Remote activation:*
- Operator safety during high-energy release
- Eliminates human tremor at trigger moment
- Allows video recording from safe position

*J-hook geometry:*
- Smooth release without snagging
- Consistent release point (±2mm repeatability)
- Easy to reset between shots

### Draw Length Consistency System

**Mechanical Stop**
- Component: Adjustable backstop plate
- Position: 36" behind anchor line
- Material: Padded aluminum plate
- Adjustment: Threaded rod with lock nuts

**Function**
- Operator draws pouch until it contacts backstop
- Ensures identical draw length every shot
- Tactile feedback confirms full draw
- **Rationale**: Eliminates human variability in draw distance (primary source of inconsistency in hand-drawn slingshots)

## COMPONENT 5: Measurement & Data Collection

### Distance Measurement System

**Primary Method: Laser Rangefinder**
- Device: Handheld laser rangefinder (±0.5m accuracy)
- Measurement: From launch point to first impact
- Protocol: Measure 3× per shot, record average

**Secondary Method: Marked Field**
- Tape measure layout every 5 meters
- Visual confirmation of rangefinder data
- Allows quick approximate readings

### Precision Measurement System

**Target Setup**
- Concentric circles: 0.5m, 1.0m, 1.5m, 2.0m radii
- Center target at calculated impact point
- Score: Distance from center to impact

**Consistency Metric**
- Fire 10 shots at same settings
- Calculate standard deviation of impact points
- Lower SD = higher precision score

### Energy Efficiency Calculation

**Input Energy Measurement**
- Method: Force gauge on draw
- Measure force every 6" of draw
- Integrate force-distance curve = work input
- Expected: ~43 J at 36" draw

**Output Energy Calculation**
- Measure projectile velocity with chronograph
- Position: 3 feet from launch point
- Calculate KE = ½mv²
- Expected: ~35 J (82% efficiency accounting for hysteresis)

**Efficiency Metric**
```
η = (Kinetic Energy of Projectile) / (Elastic Potential Energy Stored)
Target: 75-85%
```

## COMPONENT 6: Environmental Controls

### Temperature Management

**Issue**: Latex performance varies ±15% from 10°C to 30°C

**Solution**
- Pre-warm bands to 20°C (room temperature) before testing
- Method: Indoor storage 2 hours before use
- Monitor: Digital thermometer on elastic material
- **Rationale**: Consistent temperature = consistent material properties = repeatable performance

### Humidity Control

**Issue**: Latex absorbs moisture, affecting stiffness

**Solution**
- Store bands in sealed container with desiccant
- Wipe bands dry before each session
- Replace bands if exposed to rain/high humidity
- **Rationale**: Dry latex maintains consistent elastic modulus

### Material Fatigue Tracking

**Protocol**
- Log every shot fired on each band set
- Replace bands every 500 shots (conservative)
- Visual inspection before each session (cracks, discoloration)
- **Rationale**: Prevents mid-competition failure; maintains consistent performance

## PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS

### Theoretical Maximum Distance

**Calculation Basis**
- Input energy: 43 J
- System efficiency: 80%
- Projectile KE: 34.4 J
- Projectile mass: 0.085 kg
- Launch velocity: v = √(2×KE/m) = √(2×34.4/0.085) = 28.4 m/s

**Trajectory Analysis (Launch angle 40°)**
```
Horizontal velocity: 28.4 × cos(40°) = 21.8 m/s
Vertical velocity: 28.4 × sin(40°) = 18.3 m/s
Flight time: 2 × 18.3 / 9.8 = 3.7 seconds
Range: 21.8 × 3.7 = 81 meters (theoretical, no air resistance)
```

**Realistic Range (with drag)**
- Drag coefficient (sphere): ~0.47
- Frontal area: 0.0018 m²
- Air density: 1.2 kg/m³
- **Estimated actual range: 55-65 meters**

### Precision Prediction

**Sources of Variation**
1. Draw length consistency: ±5mm (mechanical stop) → ±1.5% energy variation
2. Release timing: ±10ms (mechanical trigger) → ±0.5% velocity variation
3. Elastic fatigue: ±2% over 100 shots
4. Wind (outdoor): ±3m lateral deviation at 5 m/s crosswind

**Expected Precision**
- Indoor: 10 shots within 2-meter circle at 50m
- Outdoor (calm): 10 shots within 3-meter circle at 50m
