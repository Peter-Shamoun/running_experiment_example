USER PROMPT:
Thanks for catching that design flaw! The revised problem now specifies 7075-T6 aluminum with 12mm OD and 2mm wall thickness to fix the safety factor. For the complete problem we also need: what diameter steel ball has a mass of 5g? And for the elastic attachment the problem states each band connects to the fork via a clamp and to a leather pouch via tied knots - what is the typical pouch-to-fork distance (active band length) when the draw is 75cm from a 4cm fork gap?

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
# Additional Problem Components - Revised Design

Let me solve these final parts with the updated specifications.

## Part 1: Verify Revised Design Safety Factor

### Updated Specifications:
- Material: 7075-T6 Aluminum
  - Yield strength: σ_y ≈ 505 MPa
- Tubing: 12 mm OD, 2 mm wall thickness
- Inner diameter: d_i = 12 - 2(2) = 8 mm

### Recalculate Section Properties

$$I = \frac{\pi}{64}(d_o^4 - d_i^4) = \frac{\pi}{64}[(0.012)^4 - (0.008)^4]$$

$$I = \frac{\pi}{64}[2.0736 \times 10^{-8} - 4.096 \times 10^{-9}]$$

$$I = \frac{\pi}{64}[1.664 \times 10^{-8}]$$

$$\boxed{I = 8.18 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}^4}$$

### Recalculate Bending Stress

$$\sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{M \cdot c}{I} = \frac{30 \times 0.006}{8.18 \times 10^{-10}}$$

$$\sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{0.18}{8.18 \times 10^{-10}}$$

$$\boxed{\sigma_{\text{max}} = 220 \text{ MPa}}$$

### Safety Factor

$$\text{Safety Factor} = \frac{505}{220} = \boxed{2.30}$$ ✓ **PASS!**

## Part 2: Steel Ball Diameter for 5g Mass

### Given:
- Mass: m = 5 g = 0.005 kg
- Material: Steel, ρ_steel ≈ 7850 kg/m³

### Calculate Volume

$$V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{0.005}{7850} = 6.37 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^3$$

### Calculate Diameter

For a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{\pi}{6}d^3$

$$d^3 = \frac{6V}{\pi} = \frac{6 \times 6.37 \times 10^{-7}}{\pi}$$

$$d^3 = 1.217 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3$$

$$d = (1.217 \times 10^{-6})^{1/3}$$

$$d = 0.01066 \text{ m} = 10.66 \text{ mm}$$

$$\boxed{d \approx 10.7 \text{ mm} \text{ or } 11 \text{ mm}}$$

**Standard size:** This corresponds to a **7/16 inch** (11.1 mm) or **11 mm** steel ball bearing.

## Part 3: Active Band Length (Pouch-to-Fork Distance)

This is a geometry problem involving the Y-shaped configuration.

### Given:
- Fork gap: 4 cm
- Draw distance: 75 cm (pulled back from fork)
- Each band connects from fork tip to pouch

### Geometric Setup

When drawn back, the configuration forms a triangle:
- The two fork tips are separated by 4 cm
- The pouch is pulled back 75 cm from the midpoint of the fork
- Each elastic band forms one side of this triangle

### Calculate Active Band Length

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed:
- Horizontal distance from fork center to fork tip: 4/2 = 2 cm = 0.02 m
- Vertical distance (draw): 75 cm = 0.75 m

$$L_{\text{active}} = \sqrt{(\text{draw distance})^2 + (\text{half fork gap})^2}$$

$$L_{\text{active}} = \sqrt{(0.75)^2 + (0.02)^2}$$

$$L_{\text{active}} = \sqrt{0.5625 + 0.0004}$$

$$L_{\text{active}} = \sqrt{0.5629}$$

$$\boxed{L_{\text{active}} = 0.750 \text{ m} = 75.0 \text{ cm}}$$

### Verification

The active band length at full draw is essentially equal to the draw distance because the fork gap (4 cm) is very small compared to the draw (75 cm).

**Percentage difference:**
$$\frac{75.0 - 75.0}{75.0} \times 100\% = 0.05\%$$

The fork gap contributes negligibly to the total band length.

## Part 4: Unstretched vs. Stretched Configuration

### Important Clarification

- **Unstretched length:** L₀ = 15 cm (natural length of elastic)
- **Active length at rest:** When the pouch hangs naturally between the fork tips

At rest (no draw):
$$L_{\text{rest}} = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (0.02)^2} = 0.02 \text{ m} = 2 \text{ cm}$$

But this assumes the pouch is at the fork. More realistically, with gravity and the pouch hanging:

**Typical rest configuration:** The bands would hang with some sag. If we assume the pouch hangs about 10-15 cm below the fork level:

$$L_{\text{rest}} \approx \sqrt{(0.10)^2 + (0.02)^2} \approx 10.2 \text{ cm}$$

This is still less than L₀ = 15 cm, which means **the bands are actually in compression or folded when at rest** - this is typical for slingshots where the bands are cut longer than the rest distance.

## Summary Table

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Revised Design** | | |
| Bending stress | 220 MPa | ✓ Safe |
| Safety factor | 2.30 | ✓ Acceptable |
| **Steel Ball** | | |
| Diameter | 10.7 mm | ~7/16" or 11mm |
| **Band Geometry** | | |
| Active length (drawn) | 75.0 cm | At full draw |
| Active length (rest) | ~10 cm | Hanging naturally |
| Unstretched length | 15 cm | Natural elastic length |
| Extension at full draw | 60 cm | 75 - 15 cm |

**Note:** The problem originally stated ΔL = 75 cm, which I interpreted as the extension. If L = 90 cm means the active band length is 90 cm at full draw (not 75 cm), then we'd need to recalculate with a different draw distance of approximately 90 cm, giving even higher forces and stresses.
