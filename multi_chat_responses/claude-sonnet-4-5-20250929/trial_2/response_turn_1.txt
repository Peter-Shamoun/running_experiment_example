USER PROMPT:
I'm working through a classical mechanics problem set on elastic energy systems. The problem asks: Given a Y-shaped rigid frame with two elastic elements in a symmetric configuration if each elastic element has spring constant k and unstretched length L0 and they're stretched to length L what is the total stored potential energy? Then if this energy transfers to a projectile mass m with efficiency eta what is the final velocity? Can you help me set up this physics problem mathematically?

MODEL RESPONSE:
# Y-Shaped Elastic Energy System

I'll help you set up this problem systematically.

## Part 1: Total Stored Potential Energy

For elastic elements (springs), the potential energy stored in each element is:

$$U_{\text{single}} = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2$$

where $\Delta L = L - L_0$ is the extension from the unstretched length.

Since you have **two elastic elements** in the Y-shaped configuration:

$$U_{\text{total}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{2}k(L - L_0)^2$$

$$\boxed{U_{\text{total}} = k(L - L_0)^2}$$

## Part 2: Final Velocity of Projectile

When the stored elastic energy transfers to the projectile with efficiency $\eta$ (where $0 \leq \eta \leq 1$):

**Energy transferred to projectile:**
$$E_{\text{projectile}} = \eta \cdot U_{\text{total}} = \eta k(L - L_0)^2$$

**Converting to kinetic energy:**
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \eta k(L - L_0)^2$$

**Solving for final velocity:**
$$v^2 = \frac{2\eta k(L - L_0)^2}{m}$$

$$\boxed{v = (L - L_0)\sqrt{\frac{2\eta k}{m}}}$$

## Alternative Form

You might also see this written as:
$$\boxed{v = \Delta L\sqrt{\frac{2\eta k}{m}}}$$

where $\Delta L = L - L_0$ is the total stretch.

**Key assumptions:**
- Both springs stretch equally (symmetric configuration)
- Springs obey Hooke's law
- Energy loss factor is $(1-\eta)$
- All transferred energy becomes kinetic energy of the projectile
