# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a pneumatic accumulator with a mechanical sling arm for controlled projectile launch.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Pneumatic Energy Storage**
   - Regulated air reservoir (bicycle pump charged)
   - Pressure gauge and release valve
   - Provides consistent, measurable energy input

2. **Mechanical Sling Arm**
   - Rotating arm with adjustable release point
   - Bearing-mounted pivot for low friction
   - Allows fine-tuning of launch angle

3. **Release Mechanism**
   - Trigger-activated pneumatic piston
   - Consistent timing for repeatability
   - Adjustable for different projectile masses

4. **Projectile Cradle**
   - Foam-lined cup design
   - Ensures consistent positioning
   - Minimizes energy loss during acceleration

## Contest Scoring Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Pneumatic systems have measurable input (pressure × volume), making efficiency calculations straightforward
- **Repeatability**: Regulated pressure + mechanical consistency = low shot-to-shot variation
- **Adjustability**: Multiple tuning parameters (pressure, arm length, release angle) demonstrate engineering depth
- **Safety Profile**: Low stored energy, predictable trajectories, easy emergency pressure release

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Advantages:**
- Highly controllable and measurable
- Excellent repeatability scores
- Clear physics modeling (judges appreciate this)
- Scalable design

**Limitations:**
- May not achieve maximum distance vs. pure spring/elastic systems
- Requires pressure source (adds complexity)
- Heavier than minimal designs
- More subsystems = more potential failure points

## Presentation Strategy
Emphasize the **engineering methodology**: your team can present force diagrams, energy conversion efficiency calculations, and statistical analysis of repeatability—exactly what academic judges value.
