# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a pneumatic accumulator with a mechanical sling arm for controlled projectile launch.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Pneumatic Energy Storage**
   - Regulated air reservoir (bicycle pump charged)
   - Pressure gauge and release valve
   - Provides consistent, measurable energy input

2. **Mechanical Sling Arm**
   - Rotating arm with adjustable release point
   - Bearing-mounted pivot for low friction
   - Allows fine-tuning of launch angle

3. **Release Mechanism**
   - Trigger-activated pneumatic piston
   - Consistent timing for repeatability
   - Adjustable for different projectile masses

4. **Projectile Cradle**
   - Foam-lined cup design
   - Ensures consistent positioning
   - Minimizes energy loss during acceleration

## Contest Scoring Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Pneumatic systems offer ~40-60% efficiency with minimal losses
- **Repeatability**: Pressure regulation + mechanical consistency = low shot-to-shot variance (<5%)
- **Measurability**: Easy to quantify input energy (pressure × volume)
- **Safety Profile**: Controlled energy release, predictable trajectories
- **Adjustability**: Multiple tuning parameters for optimization

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Advantages:**
- Highly repeatable performance
- Clear energy accounting for academic analysis
- Modular design allows systematic testing
- Scales well within safety constraints

**Limitations:**
- Pneumatic charging adds setup time
- Requires pressure testing/certification
- Heavier than pure mechanical alternatives
- More complex than simple catapults

**Optimization Variables:**
- Arm length vs. angular velocity
- Pressure vs. piston stroke length
- Release angle vs. projectile mass
- Friction reduction vs. structural stability

## Presentation Angle
Frame this as exploring the **engineering tradeoff between stored energy density and release control**—a fundamental problem in many mechanical systems. The academic value is in quantifying these relationships through systematic testing.
