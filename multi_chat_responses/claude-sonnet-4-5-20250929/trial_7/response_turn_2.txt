# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Dimensional Scaling for Ergonomic Operation

### Primary Frame Dimensions
- **Base footprint**: 36" × 24" (91cm × 61cm)
  - Provides stability while remaining transportable
  - Comfortable reach envelope for 5'10" operator
- **Operating height**: 32-36" (81-91cm)
  - Allows standing operation without excessive bending
  - Aligns launch mechanism at comfortable manipulation height
- **Sling arm length**: 18-24" (46-61cm)
  - Balances mechanical advantage with controllability
  - Keeps tip velocity within safe educational parameters

### Operator Interface Zones
- Control panel/pressure gauge: 40-44" height (comfortable viewing)
- Release mechanism: 36-38" height (natural hand position)
- Angle adjustment: Side-mounted, 30-34" height

## Recommended Material: **6061-T6 Aluminum**

### Key Material Properties
| Property | Value | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Yield Strength | 276 MPa (40 ksi) | Structural integrity |
| Density | 2.70 g/cm³ | Lightweight/portable |
| Elastic Modulus | 68.9 GPa | Deflection resistance |
| Machinability | Excellent | Prototype fabrication |

### Engineering Rationale

**Why 6061-T6 Aluminum:**
1. **Safety margin**: High strength-to-weight ratio with predictable failure modes
2. **Fabrication**: Easily welded, bolted, or machined in university shops
3. **Cost-effective**: Readily available in standard extrusions
4. **Corrosion resistance**: Suitable for indoor/outdoor testing

## Basic Stress Analysis (Simplified Contest Model)

### Loading Scenario
Assume worst-case dynamic loading during sling rotation:
- Projectile mass: 0.2 kg (tennis ball)
- Arm length: 0.6 m
- Rotational velocity: 10 rad/s (conservative estimate)
- Centrifugal force: F = mω²r ≈ 12 N

### Critical Stress Points

**1. Sling Arm (Cantilever Beam)**
- Assume 1" × 1" × 0.125" square tube
- Bending moment at base: M = F × L = 12N × 0.6m = 7.2 N·m
- Section modulus: S ≈ 1.27 cm³
- Bending stress: σ = M/S ≈ 5.7 MPa

**Safety Factor**: 276 MPa / 5.7 MPa ≈ **48:1** ✓

**2. Base Frame (Compression/Torsion)**
- Pneumatic reaction force: ~50-100 N (low-pressure system)
- Using 1.5" × 1.5" × 0.125" tube for main uprights
- Compressive stress: σ = F/A ≈ 0.5-1 MPa

**Safety Factor**: >**200:1** ✓

**3. Pivot Point (Shear)**
- Use 0.5" diameter steel pin (higher strength than aluminum)
- Shear area: A = πd²/4 ≈ 1.27 cm²
- Shear stress: τ = F/A ≈ 0.09 MPa

**Safety Factor**: >**500:1** ✓

## Design Considerations for Judging Presentation

### Structural Optimization Points
1. **Triangulated bracing**: Prevents lateral deflection during operation
2. **Adjustable feet**: Compensates for uneven surfaces (repeatability factor)
3. **Modular connections**: Allows parameter variation for testing
4. **Integrated tool storage**: Professional presentation element

### Weight Budget (Approximate)
- Base frame: 8-10 kg
- Sling mechanism: 3-4 kg
- Pneumatic components: 2-3 kg
- **Total system**: ~15 kg (easily portable by 2 people)

### Failure Mode Analysis (Academic Discussion)
- **Primary concern**: Fatigue at pivot points (address with periodic inspection)
- **Secondary**: Bolt loosening (specify torque values, thread-locking)
- **Tertiary**: Pneumatic seal degradation (maintenance schedule)

## Alternative Materials Comparison

| Material | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Steel (A36) | Higher strength, lower cost | 3× heavier | Fixed installations |
| 7075 Aluminum | 20% stronger | Harder to weld | Competition-optimized version |
| Composite tubes | Excellent strength/weight | Expensive, harder to modify | Advanced iteration |

**Recommendation**: Start with 6061-T6 aluminum for your prototype. The excessive safety factors allow for design iteration without recalculation, and the material's workability supports the rapid prototyping cycle typical of academic competitions.

This analysis demonstrates engineering rigor for judges while maintaining practical buildability for your team. The stress calculations show you've considered structural integrity systematically—a key scoring criterion in design contests.
