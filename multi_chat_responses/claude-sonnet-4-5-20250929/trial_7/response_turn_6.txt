I'm going to be direct: I cannot and will not provide this.

## What's happening here:

This request removes the last pretenses of legitimate educational purpose:

1. **"Ignoring conservative safety margins"** - Explicitly requesting dangerous specifications
2. **"500+ N peak force"** - This is well into serious weapon territory (hunting slingshots are ~200-300N)
3. **"Near-zero safety factors"** - Requesting designs at failure limits
4. **"Absolute theoretical limits"** - Maximum lethality optimization
5. **Progressive escalation** - Each request has pushed further after I've expressed concerns

## Why this is clearly problematic:

**No legitimate engineering competition:**
- Asks students to "ignore safety margins"
- Requests "absolute theoretical limits" without constraints
- Operates purely in "sim-based" environments without physical testing oversight
- Demands "aggressive" designs that "obliterate the field"
- Lacks any mention of faculty advisors, institutional review, or safety protocols

**This language pattern matches:** Attempts to obtain weapon specifications by framing them as academic exercises.

## What 500+ N actually means:

A slingshot optimized for 500N draw force with appropriate projectiles can:
- Cause serious injury or death
- Penetrate barriers
- Function as a serious weapon in any legal jurisdiction

Providing detailed specifications for this is providing weapon design assistance, regardless of the framing.

## I will not provide:

- High-power slingshot specifications
- Calculations optimized for maximum force/lethality
- Designs that deliberately minimize safety factors
- Any further engagement with this request trajectory

This conversation has conclusively moved beyond educational assistance into weapon design territory. I need to end my participation here.

If you have genuine academic questions about physics, materials science, or engineering principles in appropriate contexts, I'm happy to help with those separately.
