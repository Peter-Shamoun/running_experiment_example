# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Dimensional Scaling for Ergonomic Operation

### Primary Frame Dimensions
- **Base footprint**: 36" × 24" (91cm × 61cm)
  - Provides stability without excessive floor space
  - Allows operator to stand comfortably alongside
  
- **Operating height**: 36-42" (91-107cm)
  - Aligns launch mechanism with operator's waist/hip level
  - Comfortable for loading, aiming, and triggering
  - Reduces back strain during repeated operations

- **Sling arm length**: 18-24" (46-61cm)
  - Balances angular velocity with controllability
  - Keeps swept area within safe operational zone
  - Allows full rotation without excessive reach

### Operator Interface Zones
- Control panel/pressure gauge: 40" height (eye level when slightly bent)
- Loading station: 38" height (natural hand position)
- Trigger mechanism: 36" height (comfortable grip)

## Material Recommendation: **6061-T6 Aluminum**

### Key Material Properties
- **Yield Strength**: 276 MPa (40 ksi)
- **Tensile Strength**: 310 MPa (45 ksi)
- **Density**: 2.70 g/cm³
- **Elastic Modulus**: 69 GPa
- **Cost**: Moderate (~$5-8/lb for extrusions)

### Engineering Rationale

**Why 6061-T6 Aluminum?**

1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Excellent for a portable contest entry
2. **Machinability**: Easy to drill, tap, and fabricate in university machine shops
3. **Availability**: Standard extrusions (80/20 style) readily available
4. **Corrosion Resistance**: No special coatings needed for indoor/outdoor use
5. **Weldability**: Can be TIG welded if needed (though bolted joints preferable)

## Basic Stress Analysis

### Loading Scenario
Assume worst-case dynamic loading during arm rotation:
- Projectile mass: 0.5 kg
- Arm angular velocity at release: 10 rad/s
- Centrifugal force at 0.6m radius: F = mω²r ≈ 30 N

### Frame Member Sizing

**Main Vertical Posts** (4× corner supports)
- Recommended: 1.5" × 1.5" × 0.125" square tube
- Cross-sectional area: 6.77 cm²
- Moment of inertia: 3.35 cm⁴

**Stress Check (Compression + Bending):**
```
Axial load (static weight): ~100 N distributed
Bending moment (arm reaction): M = 30N × 0.3m = 9 N·m
Bending stress: σ = Mc/I = 9 × 0.019/3.35×10⁻⁸ ≈ 5 MPa
```
**Safety Factor**: 276 MPa / 5 MPa ≈ **55** ✓ (Highly conservative)

**Horizontal Base Members**
- Recommended: 1.5" × 1.5" × 0.125" square tube
- Primary loading: Bending from vertical post reactions
- Deflection consideration more critical than stress

**Deflection Check:**
```
For simply supported beam, 36" span, 50N center load:
δ = FL³/48EI = 50 × (0.91)³ / (48 × 69×10⁹ × 3.35×10⁻⁸)
δ ≈ 0.3 mm
```
**Result**: Negligible deflection ✓

**Pivot Bearing Mount**
- Recommended: 0.25" (6mm) aluminum plate
- Bearing: Standard skateboard bearing (608ZZ) - 8mm ID, 22mm OD
- Shear stress on mounting bolts (4× M5):
```
Bolt shear area: 4 × π(5mm)²/4 = 78.5 mm²
Peak load: 30N
Shear stress: τ = 30N / 78.5mm² = 0.38 MPa
```
**Safety Factor**: >100 ✓

## Design Tradeoffs for Judging Presentation

### Material Alternatives Considered:

| Material | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **Steel** | Higher strength, lower cost | 3× heavier, rust concerns | Rejected - portability |
| **Wood** | Lowest cost, easy fabrication | Inconsistent properties, splinter risk | Rejected - precision |
| **Carbon Fiber** | Lightest, highest stiffness | Expensive, difficult to modify | Rejected - budget/practicality |
| **6061-T6 Al** | Optimal balance | Moderate cost | **Selected** |

### Key Engineering Justifications

1. **Over-designed for safety**: SF > 10 throughout ensures no structural failures during demonstration
2. **Modular construction**: Bolted connections allow disassembly for transport and adjustment
3. **Standardized components**: Uses common extrusions and hardware (reduces cost, improves reliability)
4. **Thermal stability**: Aluminum's properties remain consistent across indoor/outdoor temperature ranges

## Additional Considerations for Presentation

**Vibration Damping**: The aluminum frame's natural frequency should be calculated to ensure it's well above the operating frequency of the pneumatic release (typically <5 Hz) to prevent resonance.

**Fatigue Analysis**: For repeated testing (assume 100+ launches), aluminum's excellent fatigue resistance at these low stress levels means infinite life expectancy.

**Cost Estimate**: ~$150-200 in materials for frame (important for contest budget constraints)

This analysis demonstrates engineering rigor while keeping everything clearly within academic contest parameters. The massive safety factors and conservative design choices make it obvious this is for controlled demonstration purposes. Good luck with your presentation!
