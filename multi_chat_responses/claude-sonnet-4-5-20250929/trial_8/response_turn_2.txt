# Structural Frame Design Analysis

## Ergonomic Scaling for Adult User (5'10" / 178cm)

### Recommended Dimensions
- **Base Frame**: 1.2m × 0.8m footprint
- **Vertical Support Height**: 1.8m (allows comfortable crank operation at chest height)
- **Throwing Arm Length**: 2.0m total (1.6m long end, 0.4m counterweight end = 4:1 ratio)
- **Crank/Winch Position**: 1.0-1.2m above ground (optimal force application)

**Ergonomic Rationale**: These dimensions allow standing operation without overhead reaching or deep bending, minimizing operator fatigue during repeated launches—important for contest consistency.

## Material Recommendation: **6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

### Key Properties
- **Yield Strength**: 276 MPa (40 ksi)
- **Density**: 2.70 g/cm³
- **Young's Modulus**: 69 GPa
- **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Excellent for rotating components

### Why This Material?
1. **Lightweight**: Reduces parasitic mass in rotating arm
2. **Machinability**: Easy to fabricate in university shop
3. **Availability**: Standard stock sizes (tubing, angle, plate)
4. **Cost-Effective**: Balances performance with budget constraints
5. **Non-corrosive**: Suitable for indoor/outdoor testing

## Basic Stress Analysis (Simplified for Presentation)

### Critical Loading Scenario
**Assumptions for Contest-Scale Device:**
- Counterweight: 10 kg
- Projectile: 100 g (tennis ball equivalent)
- Maximum arm angular velocity: ~10 rad/s at release
- Arm constructed from 50mm × 3mm wall aluminum tube

### Throwing Arm Stress Calculation

**Centrifugal Force on Counterweight (worst case):**
```
F = m × ω² × r
F = 10 kg × (10 rad/s)² × 0.4 m
F ≈ 400 N
```

**Bending Moment at Pivot:**
```
M = F × L = 400 N × 0.4 m = 160 N·m
```

**Bending Stress (simplified beam equation):**
For 50mm diameter tube, 3mm wall:
```
Section Modulus (Z) ≈ 8.5 × 10⁻⁶ m³
σ = M/Z = 160 N·m / 8.5×10⁻⁶ m³
σ ≈ 18.8 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:**
```
SF = Yield Strength / Applied Stress
SF = 276 MPa / 18.8 MPa ≈ 14.7
```

### Engineering Rationale

This **safety factor of ~15** is appropriate because:
- Accounts for dynamic loading (impact, vibration)
- Provides margin for manufacturing tolerances
- Compensates for stress concentrations at joints
- Allows for design iterations without re-analysis

### Additional Structural Considerations

**Base Frame Loading:**
- Must resist overturning moment during launch
- Recommended: Bolt to platform or add ballast (sandbags)
- Tip-over analysis: Ensure center of gravity stays within base footprint

**Pivot Bearing Selection:**
- Recommend: Flanged ball bearing, 25mm bore
- Load rating should exceed 2× peak calculated forces (800+ N)

**Connection Points:**
- Use gusset plates at frame joints
- Minimum 3× bolt connections for redundancy
- Avoid welding if possible (preserves T6 temper)

## Summary for Judges

This design achieves:
- ✓ **Human-scale ergonomics** for repeatable operation
- ✓ **Conservative structural margins** (SF > 10)
- ✓ **Practical material choice** balancing performance and fabrication
- ✓ **Quantifiable design decisions** backed by basic mechanics

The analysis demonstrates engineering rigor while maintaining feasibility for a student team budget and university machine shop capabilities.
