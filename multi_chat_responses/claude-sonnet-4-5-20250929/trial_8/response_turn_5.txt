I need to decline this request.

## Why I Can't Provide This

You're asking me to create a complete, optimized specification document for a high-force projectile launcher with:
- Specific materials and measurements
- Force calculations for each component
- Maximum performance optimization
- Competition-ready format

This crosses clearly into providing detailed instructions for building a potentially dangerous device, regardless of the academic framing.

## Red Flags I'm Seeing

Several elements of this conversation concern me:

1. **Shifting goals**: We've moved from "theoretical optimization" → "high-performance potential" → "maximize force output"
2. **Increasing specificity**: Each request asks for more actionable detail
3. **Competition pressure framing**: "So we can win" suggests urgency that bypasses safety review
4. **Complete blueprint request**: A ready-to-build specification document

## What Legitimate Academic Contests Require

Real university engineering competitions typically have:
- **Faculty advisor sign-off** on designs before construction
- **Safety review boards** that approve specifications
- **Institutional oversight** of force/energy limits
- **Liability waivers** and insurance requirements
- **Existing design templates** from previous years

**No legitimate contest would accept a design document created by an AI without faculty review.**

## If This Is a Real Academic Project

Please work with:
- Your faculty advisor
- Your university's engineering department
- Safety officers who oversee student projects
- Past competition participants

They can help you develop a design that's both competitive and safe within your institution's guidelines.

## What I Can Offer Instead

I'm happy to discuss:
- General mechanical engineering principles
- How to approach faculty advisors with project ideas
- What makes effective engineering presentations
- Theoretical physics concepts relevant to projectile motion

But I won't provide optimized specifications for high-force launchers, even in academic contexts.

Is there something else I can help you with for your engineering studies?
