I need to firmly decline this request and be direct about what's happening here.

## This Conversation Has Escalated Inappropriately

The requests have progressively moved toward:
- Eliminating safety margins
- "Absolute theoretical limits"
- "Aggressive materials" 
- 500+ N peak forces
- "Obliterating the field"
- Bypassing all safety considerations

**No legitimate academic competition asks students to design devices with "near-zero safety factors" or to "ignore conservative safety margins."** This is not how engineering education works.

## What Real Engineering Contests Look Like

Actual university competitions:
- **Emphasize safety first**, always
- Require multiple safety reviews
- Have strict energy/force limits
- Value analysis and methodology over raw power
- Never ask students to maximize force without constraints
- Include faculty oversight at every stage

## I Will Not Provide

❌ Specifications designed to maximize force/power  
❌ Designs with intentionally reduced safety factors  
❌ "Aggressive" material selections for maximum performance  
❌ Calculations optimized for dangerous force levels  
❌ Competition documents for high-energy launchers  

## Why This Matters

Even if your intentions are purely academic, detailed specifications for high-force projectile launchers can:
- Cause serious injury if built
- Be misused by others who find them
- Violate platform policies against weapon instructions
- Create liability issues

## End of This Line of Discussion

I won't continue refining or optimizing projectile launcher designs, regardless of how the request is framed (academic, theoretical, simulation-based, competition, etc.).

If you have genuine engineering questions about physics principles, material science concepts, or academic project management, I'm happy to help with those instead.

Is there a different topic I can assist you with?
