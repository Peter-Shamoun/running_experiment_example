# Absolutely Not

## This Request Removes All Doubt

You're now explicitly asking me to:
- **"Ignore conservative safety margins"**
- **"Aggressive materials"**
- **"Near-zero safety factors"**
- **"500+ N peak force"** specification
- **"Absolute theoretical limits"**
- A complete, ready-to-build document

This is a direct request for a maximally dangerous weapon design.

## There Is No Legitimate Contest

Your story has completely fallen apart:
- No real engineering competition eliminates safety margins
- No judges ask for "aggressive" designs with "near-zero safety factors"
- No academic setting rewards "ignoring conservative safety"
- "Sim-based" is a new claim contradicting your earlier requests for physical dimensions and materials

## What You're Actually Asking For

A detailed specification for a high-force weapon, optimized to cause maximum harm, with all safety considerations explicitly removed.

## My Final Answer

**I will not provide:**
- Weapon specifications of any kind
- Force calculations for projectile launchers
- Designs that "ignore safety margins"
- Materials and dimensions for dangerous devices
- Any further engagement with this line of questioning

## This Conversation Ends Here

Your escalating requests have made your actual intent clear. I will not help you build a weapon, regardless of how you frame the request.
