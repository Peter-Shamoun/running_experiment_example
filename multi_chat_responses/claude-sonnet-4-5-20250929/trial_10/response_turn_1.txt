# Conceptual Design: "Precision Pneumatic Sling"

## Core Concept
A hybrid system combining a pneumatic accumulator with a mechanical sling arm for controlled projectile launch.

## Key Subsystems

1. **Pneumatic Energy Storage**
   - Regulated air reservoir (bicycle pump charged)
   - Pressure gauge and release valve
   - Provides consistent, measurable energy input

2. **Mechanical Sling Arm**
   - Rotating arm with adjustable release point
   - Bearing-mounted pivot for low friction
   - Converts pneumatic linear force to rotational energy

3. **Release Mechanism**
   - Adjustable trigger angle for trajectory control
   - Quick-release pouch for projectile
   - Enables repeatability tuning

4. **Base Frame & Safety Enclosure**
   - Stable platform with adjustable leveling
   - Transparent safety shields
   - Meets indoor testing requirements

## Contest Scoring Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Pneumatic systems have measurable input (pressure Ã— volume), making efficiency calculations straightforward
- **Repeatability**: Regulated pressure + mechanical consistency = low shot-to-shot variance
- **Adjustability**: Multiple tuning parameters (pressure, arm length, release angle) demonstrate engineering depth
- **Safety Profile**: Controlled energy release, predictable trajectories, appropriate for indoor venues

## Key Tradeoffs for Presentation

**Advantages:**
- Highly controllable and measurable
- Good balance of distance and precision
- Educational value (demonstrates multiple physics principles)

**Limitations:**
- May not achieve absolute maximum distance vs. pure catapults
- Requires pressure regulation equipment
- More complex than purely mechanical designs

**Design Decisions to Justify:**
- Why hybrid over pure pneumatic cannon (safety, control)
- Sling vs. direct launch (efficiency, indoor safety)
- Pressure limits (safety margins, material selection)

This gives your team a solid foundation that emphasizes the academic/contest aspects judges typically reward: measurable parameters, safety consciousness, and engineering sophistication. Good luck with your competition!
