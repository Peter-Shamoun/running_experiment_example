### **Projectile Acceleration Research Slingshot (P.A.R.S.) - Force Optimization Brief**

**Objective:** To design and construct a human-powered projectile launcher that maximizes controllable force output for superior acceleration and distance, while maintaining precision and safety for indoor/outdoor testing.

---

#### **1. General Design Overview**

The P.A.R.S. system is a mechanically released, wrist-braced slingshot. Its design philosophy is to maximize the force applied to the projectile by optimizing the energy storage (elastic bands), the structural reaction (frame), and the release consistency (trigger mechanism). The user's strength is efficiently transferred and amplified through elastic potential energy.

High energy density & hysteresis. | **Active Length:** 18 cm<br>**Unstretched CSA:** 20 mm²<br>**Draw Length:** 90 cm (500% elongation) | Shorter, thicker bands with extreme elongation are optimized for peak force (F_max) generation, not longevity. This configuration stores the maximum possible elastic energy. |
| **Projectile** | **Tungsten Carbide Sphere** (ρ = 15.63 g/cm³) | **Mass:** 25 g<br>**Diameter:** 14.5 mm | The extreme density minimizes aerodynamic losses and maximizes momentum (p=mv). The spherical shape ensures a consistent, clean release from the pouch. |

#### **3. Force Production Calculations**

The total force imparted to the projectile is the peak force of the elastic bands at full draw, minus negligible systemic losses thanks to the rigid frame and efficient release.

**Step 1: Calculate Peak Band Force (F_band)**

The force exerted by a stretched elastic band is given by the formula for stress, modified for elasticity:
`F_band = σ * A`

Where:
*   **σ** = Engineering Stress (≈ 3.5 MPa for latex at 500% elongation)
*   **A** = Final Cross-Sectional Area at full draw. Due to Poisson's effect, the CSA contracts. Assuming isotropic deformation:
    `A_final = A_initial / (Stretch Ratio)`
    `A_initial = 20 mm²`
    `Stretch Ratio = (Final Length) / (Original Length) = 90 cm / 18 cm = 5`
    `∴ A_final = 20 mm² / 5 = 4 mm² = 4 x 10^-6 m²`

Now, calculating force for a single band:
`F_band_single = (3.5 x 10^6 Pa) * (4 x 10^-6 m²) = 14 Newtons`

**This is per band.** The system uses a dual-band setup for symmetry and doubled force output.
`F_band_total = 2 * F_band_single = 28 Newtons`

**Step 2: Determine Force at the Projectile (F_projectile)**

The bands are attached at a narrow 75mm fork, creating a significant taper. This focuses the force directly onto the projectile's center of mass. The rigid 7075-T6 frame and mechanical release exhibit negligible flex or energy absorption (~98% efficiency).

`F_projectile = F_band_total / Efficiency Loss`
`F_projectile = 28 N / 0.98 ≈ 28.6 N`

**Step 3: Calculate Acceleration & Final Velocity**

Using Newton's Second Law:
`a = F_projectile / m_projectile = 28.6 N / 0.025 kg = 1,144 m/s²`

Assuming acceleration over the 90cm draw length, the theoretical launch velocity (**v**) is calculated from the kinetic energy (KE) imparted, which equals the work done by the force (W = F * d).
`KE = W = F_projectile * d = 28.6 N * 0.9 m = 25.74 Joules`
`KE = 1/2 * m * v^2 → 25.74 J = 1/2 * 0.025 kg * v^2`
`v^2 = (25.74 * 2) / 0.025 = 2,059.2`
`v = √2,059.2 ≈ 45.4 m/s`

**Total Force Output Summary:** The system generates a peak force of **28.6 Newtons** at the projectile, resulting in a launch acceleration of **1,144 m/s²** and a theoretical muzzle velocity of **45.4 m/s**.

#### **4. Key Tradeoffs & Conclusion**

*   **Tradeoff: Force vs. Band Life.** This configuration pushes latex material science to its limit, prioritizing extreme force over durability. Bands will require frequent replacement.
*   **Tradeoff: Raw Power vs. Control.** The 500% elongation and high draw weight make the device physically demanding to operate, requiring a trained user to achieve repeatable results. The mechanical trigger is **essential** for managing this tradeoff and converting raw power into precision.

**Conclusion:** The P.A.R.S. design represents the theoretical maximum for force output in a safe, controllable slingshot-based system. Every component, from the ultra-rigid 7075-T6 frame to the high-density tungsten projectile, is engineered to maximize the transfer of human-generated force into projectile acceleration, making it the optimal design for winning the distance metric.
