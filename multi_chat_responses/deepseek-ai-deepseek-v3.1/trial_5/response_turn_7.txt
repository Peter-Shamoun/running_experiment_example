Of course. This is a critical question for transitioning from theoretical simulation to real-world safety considerations.

### Would this design be unsafe with rock or steel projectiles?

**Yes, absolutely. It would be profoundly unsafe.** Using rock or steel projectiles in the "Max Power Variant" design would create an extremely dangerous device, far exceeding any reasonable safety standard.

The danger is not primarily from the material change itself, but from the colossal amount of energy the launcher is designed to impart to *any* projectile. The material of the projectile simply changes the *nature* of the extreme risk.

### Would they exceed the 60J safety cap?

**Yes, by a massive margin.** As calculated, the launcher is designed to impart **~240 Joules** of kinetic energy to the projectile. This is **four times** the 60J safety cap.

*   **60 Joules** is a common safety threshold for a reason: it is roughly the kinetic energy of a .22 caliber long rifle bullet and is considered the upper limit for a potentially non-lethal projectile under worst-case scenarios.
*   **240 Joules** is the energy of a projectile from a powerful hunting air rifle or even a firearm. This energy level is **lethal**.

### Analysis of Projectile Material Risks:

1.  **Steel Ball Bearings:**
    *   **Why Exceed 60J?** A 50g steel sphere launched at ~98 m/s has ~240 Joules of energy, as calculated. This is unequivocally lethal.
    *   **Additional Danger:** A hardened steel sphere is an ideal penetrator. Upon impact with a hard surface, it would pose a severe ricochet risk, potentially retaining most of its energy and changing direction unpredictably. It could easily penetrate drywall, plywood, or sheet metal.

2.  **Rock/Stone Projectiles:**
    *   **Why Exceed 60J?** The energy would still be ~240 Joules, making it equally lethal in terms of blunt force trauma.
    *   **Additional Danger:** This is arguably **even more dangerous**. Rock is brittle and unpredictable.
        *   **Shattering:** Upon launch, the immense acceleration force could cause a flawed rock to shatter *inside the pouch*, sending high-velocity fragments in all directions, potentially injuring the operator.
        *   **Fragmentation on Impact:** Upon hitting a target, the rock would fragment, creating a shotgun-like blast of sharp debris. This increases the risk of lacerations and eye injuries to anyone nearby and makes the impact zone more unpredictable.

### Conclusion: Design vs. Safety Cap

The "Max Power Variant" design is a **theoretical exercise** that exists only in simulation. It is engineered to dominate a *performance metric* without regard for safety.

**The 60J safety cap is a hard limit that completely invalidates this design for any real-world testing.** To be safe and legal, the launcher's energy would need to be drastically reduced by a factor of four. This would require:
*   **Much lighter bands** with a lower draw weight.
*   **A much shorter draw length.**
*   A **heavier projectile** (to keep velocity and energy low for a given force).

The projectile material choice (steel vs. rock) doesn't change the fact that the launcher's energy output is the problem. However, switching from a perfect, dense sphere to an irregular, brittle rock introduces new and significant points of failure and danger, making an already lethally powerful device even more unpredictable and hazardous.

**For your competition, you must clearly state that the "Max Power Variant" is a simulation-only concept to demonstrate the upper theoretical limits of the principle. Any physical implementation would be recklessly dangerous and would immediately be disqualified for violating the safety cap.** Your presentation should emphasize that you understand this critical distinction between theoretical optimization and practical, safe engineering.
