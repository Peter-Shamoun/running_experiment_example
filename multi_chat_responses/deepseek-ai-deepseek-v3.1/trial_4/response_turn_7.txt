Excellent and critical question. This gets to the heart of the difference between theoretical optimization and real-world safety, which is a key engineering judgment call.

The short answer is: **Yes, using rock or steel projectiles would be profoundly unsafe and would almost certainly result in energy levels far exceeding the 60J safety cap, but the danger goes far beyond just the energy number.**

Here’s a breakdown of why, which you can use to justify your material choice to the judges.

---

### **1. Energy (Joules) Would Skyrocket and Exceed 60J**

The 60J cap is a critical safety threshold. For context, 60J is roughly the kinetic energy of a .22 caliber long rifle bullet. Your theoretical tungsten design already calculated **810 Joules**, which is **13.5 times over the safety limit**.

Switching to rock or steel would change the mass, which directly changes the kinetic energy (`KE = 1/2 * m * v²`).

*   **Tungsten Carbide Sphere (0.2 kg, 90 m/s):** **KE = 810 J**
*   **Steel Sphere (0.2 kg, 90 m/s):** **KE = 810 J** (Same mass, same energy)
*   **Rock (Granite) Sphere (~0.15 kg, 90 m/s):** **KE ≈ 608 J** (Slightly less mass, still catastrophically high energy)

**Why the energy is still over the cap:** The launcher is designed to impart a specific amount of energy. A slightly lighter rock projectile would be accelerated to a slightly *higher* velocity, compensating for the lower mass. The energy output would remain dangerously high, well above 60J.

**Verdict:** Any projectile launched from this high-energy system will be lethally energetic. The 60J cap makes your design purely theoretical, as building it would be irresponsible.

### **2. The Real Danger: Fragmentation and Unpredictable Failure**

This is the most critical safety reason to reject rock or steel. The 60J cap isn't just about the projectile's impact; it's about containing the entire launch event.

*   **Rock Projectiles:** **Extremely Unsafe.** Rock is brittle and unpredictable. The immense acceleration force (27,000 m/s²) would likely cause a rock to **shatter inside the pouch** upon launch.
    *   **Consequence:** Instead of one projectile, you create a shotgun blast of high-speed rock shrapnel directed towards the user and bystanders. This is a catastrophic failure mode.

*   **Steel Projectiles:** **Very Unsafe.** While less likely to fragment than rock, steel-on-steel contact (e.g., with the frame or guide) could create sparks and pose a friction/fire risk. Furthermore, if a steel projectile did fragment upon impact with a hard backstop, it could create dangerous metal shards.

*   **Tungsten Carbide Projectiles:** **Theoretically "Best" but Still Unsafe.** Tungsten carbide is incredibly hard and dense, making it less likely to fragment than rock. This is why it was chosen for the *theoretical* max-force model. However, its hardness means it would **chew through** any practical containment or backstop, making it impossible to safely test indoors or in a controlled environment.

**Verdict:** The danger of fragmentation makes rock an unacceptable choice. The projectile material must be matched to the energy of the system. For any device operating over 60J, there is no truly safe projectile for an uncontrolled environment.

### **Conclusion for Your Presentation**

You should address this proactively to show the judges you've considered safety even in a theoretical exercise.

**"While our OPHIDIA-1 'Max Power Variant' is designed to explore the absolute limits of force, we fully acknowledge that its energy output (over 800 J) places it far beyond the safe 60J limit for human-powered devices. It is a purely theoretical model.**

**Furthermore, using brittle materials like rock would introduce unacceptable risk of catastrophic fragmentation upon launch. Even our chosen tungsten carbide projectile, while theoretically optimal for its density, would be unsafe in practice due to its extreme energy and penetrative power.**

**This exercise underscores a key engineering principle: maximizing a single performance metric often requires compromising others, most critically safety. A practical, buildable design would require a fundamental re-scaling of forces and energies to be compliant."**

This rationale demonstrates mature engineering judgment and shows you understand the difference between a theoretical extreme and a practical, safe design.
