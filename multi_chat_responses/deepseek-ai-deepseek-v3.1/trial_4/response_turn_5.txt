### **Project: Titanoboa Launcher - Design Brief**
**Objective:** To design and theoretically optimize a human-powered projectile launcher for maximum force output.

---

#### **1. General Device Design**
The **Titanoboa Launcher** is a dual-stage, compound slingshot system. It utilizes a cascaded elastic energy storage design to amplify human input force through sequential mechanical advantage, culminating in an extremely high-impulse release.

**Core Subsystems:**
*   **Stage 1 - Primary Draw (Force Amplification):** A long draw arm with a pulley system reduces the force required from the user by a factor of 4.
*   **Stage 2 - Secondary Elastic (Energy Storage):** The primary arm tensions two sets of high-performance latex bands, pre-loading the main energy store.
*   **Stage 3 - Tertiary Release (Force Concentration):** A trigger mechanism releases the pre-loaded bands to accelerate a constrained plunger, which transfers energy to the projectile over a short, optimized distance, maximizing impulse and final force.

**Visual Concept:** A large, crossbow-like frame with a long draw arm. Pulling the arm back stretches two sets of bands. Releasing the trigger fires the plunger forward, launching the projectile.

#### **3. Rationale Behind Design Choices**
The design prioritizes **Force (F = m * a)**. To maximize F:
1.  **Maximize Acceleration (a):** Achieved by storing immense energy in the stretched bands and releasing it to accelerate the projectile over a very short distance.
2.  **Maximize Mass (m):** A dense tungsten projectile ensures the force is applied to a significant mass.
3.  **Sequential Loading:** The pulley system allows a human to tension bands that would otherwise be impossible to draw directly, accessing a much higher energy potential.
4.  **Impulse Optimization:** The plunger design converts the elastic energy into a sharp, high-force impulse rather than a longer, lower-force push, dramatically increasing peak acceleration.

#### **4. Force Production Calculations**

**Assumption:** The elastic bands behave as ideal springs for this theoretical calculation. The effective spring constant `k` is derived from material properties and geometry.

**Step 1: Calculate Energy Stored (E_stored)**
*   The pulley system provides a 4:1 mechanical advantage. A 400N user input force creates **1600N of tension** in the primary bands.
*   This tension force `F_band` is equal to `k_effective * Δx`.
*   Therefore, `k_effective = F_band / Δx = 1600 N / 2.0 m = 800 N/m`.
*   **E_stored = ½ * k * (Δx)² = ½ * 800 N/m * (2.0 m)² = 1600 Joules**

**Step 2: Calculate Projectile Exit Velocity (v)**
*   Assume 85% energy transfer efficiency (η) due to friction and other losses.
*   Kinetic Energy (KE) = η * E_stored = 0.85 * 1600 J = **1360 J**
*   KE = ½ * m * v² ; where m = projectile mass (0.1 kg)
*   Therefore, v = √( (2 * KE) / m ) = √( (2 * 1360 J) / 0.1 kg ) = **164.9 m/s**

**Step 3: Calculate Average Acceleration (a) and Force (F)**
*   The plunger accelerates the projectile over a distance `d = 0.2 m`.
*   Use the kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2a*d ; where initial velocity u = 0.
*   Therefore, a = v² / (2 * d) = (164.9 m/s)² / (2 * 0.2 m) = **67,950 m/s²**
*   **F = m * a = 0.1 kg * 67,950 m/s² = 6,795 Newtons**

**Step 4: Final Force Output**
*   **Theoretical Average Force Output: 6,795 N**
*   This is the average force during the acceleration phase. Peak force will be higher.
