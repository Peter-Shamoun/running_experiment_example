USER PROMPT:
Perfect design! I need a few final details for complete documentation: 1) How should the elastic bands attach to the frame - specific attachment hardware/method for the anchor points? 2) What material and dimensions for the projectile cup that connects the bands to the projectile via the pulley system? 3) What fabrication methods should be used to construct the aluminum frame (welding, bolting, etc.)? 4) For the human factors: what's the estimated total work input (Joules) the operator must provide during the 3.0m pull with the 2:1 mechanical advantage?

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Excellent questions. These final implementation details are crucial for a safe, high-performance build. Here is the complete specification.

### 1. Elastic Band Attachment Hardware & Method

The anchor points are critical failure points. They must be designed to handle the peak force (~720 N per anchor, but with a significant safety factor) without tearing, pulling out, or fatiguing.

**Recommended Hardware:**
*   **Anchor Plates:** Use **6.35 mm (1/4") thick 6061 Aluminum plate** for all anchor points. This thickness is robust enough to resist bending under load.
*   **Fasteners:** Use **Grade 8 (or Class 10.9 metric) shoulder bolts** or **eye bolts**.
    *   **Size:** **M10 (10 mm diameter)**. A single M10 bolt has a tensile strength of ~17,000 N, providing a massive safety factor.
    *   **Why Shoulder Bolts?** The smooth shoulder section prevents thread wear on the band attachment loop and provides a cleaner pivot point.
*   **Band Attachment Method:**
    1.  **Create Loops:** Form a loop at each end of the latex tubing using a **high-strength constrictor knot** (e.g., a double overhand knot) around a **robust dowel or a polished aluminum mandrel**.
    2.  **Protect the Tube:** Protect the latex from cutting by sleeving it with a short piece of **braided polyester sleeve** or **heat shrink tubing** at the knot point.
    3.  **Connect to Anchor:** Slip this loop directly over the shoulder of the bolt. Use a **large, polished steel washer** on either side of the loop to keep it centered and prevent chafing against the aluminum plate.
    4.  **Secure:** Fasten with a **self-locking nut** (e.g., a Nyloc nut) to prevent loosening from vibration.

**Design:** The anchor plates should be welded or bolted to the main frame structure at the calculated positions to form the "V" for the four bands.

### 2. Projectile Cup Specifications

The projectile cup is the interface between the elastic system and the projectile. Its design goals are to:
*   **Engage securely** with the projectile without slipping.
*   **Release cleanly** at the end of the launch stroke.
*   Be as **lightweight** as possible to maximize the energy transferred to the projectile (instead of accelerating itself).
*   Have **low friction** on the launch rail.

**Material:** **Delrin (Acetal) or UHMW Polyethylene**. These engineering plastics are incredibly tough, have a very low coefficient of friction, and are easy to machine.

**Design:**
*   **Cup Body:** A cylindrical block, approximately **50 mm in diameter x 40 mm tall**.
*   **Cavity:** Machine a shallow **concave spherical cavity** (not a tight-fitting bore) in the top to cradle the steel projectile. A radius of **~25 mm** works well for a 38mm projectile. This shape ensures a centered, consistent launch without creating suction or drag.
*   **Mass:** The finished cup should weigh **< 50 grams**.
*   **Connection Point:**
    1.  **Integral Pulley:** The most efficient method. Machine the cup to incorporate a **10-15 mm diameter groove** around its base to act as its own pulley. This minimizes parts and weight.
    2.  **Alternative:** Embed a **low-friction pulley wheel** into the side of the Delrin block using a small stainless steel axle.
*   **Launch Arm Interface:** The cup will be attached to the end of the 1.2m aluminum launch arm. The arm should terminate in a **fork**. The cup sits between the forks, pinned through its center with a **stainless steel axle** that also serves as the pulley axle. This allows the cup to pivot freely for alignment.

### 3. Aluminum Frame Fabrication Method

**Primary Method: ** **TIG Welding with Precision Jigging**
*   **Why TIG?** It offers the strongest, most precise, and cleanest welds for aluminum. It allows for excellent penetration and control, minimizing heat distortion.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Precision Cutting:** Use a chop saw with a fine-toothed blade for aluminum to get perfect 90-degree or precisely mitered cuts.
    2.  **Notching (Fishmouthing):** For all tube-to-tube connections, use a **hole saw** or a **tube notcher** to create a perfect contour match between the tubes. This increases weld surface area and dramatically improves strength and aesthetics.
    3.  **Jigging:** Construct the entire frame in a **flat, rigid welding jig** made from angle iron or plywood. This is non-negotiable to ensure all angles are correct and the frame is square. Weld in stages to manage heat.
    4.  **Post-Processing:** Clean all welds, and sand the entire frame to remove sharp edges.

**Secondary Method: ** **Bolted Construction with Gusseted Joints**
*   **Why Bolt?** If welding is not an option, this is a viable alternative. It allows for disassembly and tuning.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Internal Sleeves:** For tube-to-tube joints, use an **internal aluminum sleeve** that fits snugly inside the larger tube. Drill through both tubes and the sleeve.
    2.  **Fasteners:** Use **Grade 5 or 8 bolts** with **nylon-insert locknuts**.
    3.  **Gussets:** Reinforce every single major joint with **3.17 mm (1/8") thick aluminum gusset plates** cut into right-angle triangles. These are essential to resist the bending moments that bolted joints alone cannot handle.

### 4. Human Factors: Total Operator Work Input

This calculates the physical effort required from the operator.

**Given:**
*   **Operator Pull Distance:** `d_op = 3.0 m` (due to the 2:1 mechanical advantage)
*   The force the operator applies (`F_op`) is half the force in the elastic bands (`F_band`) due to the pulley: `F_op = F_band / 2`
*   The force in the bands is not constant. It starts low and ends high.

**Calculation:**
We know the average band force (`F_band_avg`) over its stretch is ~385 N (from previous calculation).
Therefore, the **average operator force** is:
`F_op_avg = F_band_avg / 2 = 385 N / 2 = 192.5 N`

**Total Work Input by Operator (`W_op`):**
Work is force times distance. The operator applies an average force of ~192.5 N over a distance of 3.0 m.
`W_op = F_op_avg * d_op = 192.5 N * 3.0 m = 577.5 Joules`

**Why this makes sense:** This value is almost identical to the stored energy we calculated (~540-577 J). This confirms the model is consistent. The operator inputs ~577 J of mechanical work, which is stored as ~540 J of elastic potential energy in the bands (the small difference accounts for friction losses in the pulley during the drawing process). This energy is then converted to ~405 J of kinetic energy in the projectile with 75% efficiency.

**Human Factors Note:** Pulling 192.5 N (approximately **19.6 kg** or **43.2 lbs** of force) over a 3-meter distance is a significant but manageable effort for a healthy adult. It should feel similar to drawing a very heavy compound bow. The operator will need a good footing and a consistent pulling technique to achieve repeatable results.
