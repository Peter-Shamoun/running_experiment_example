USER PROMPT:
This framework is perfect. Now I need to translate it into concrete specifications. Can you provide: 1) Exact frame dimensions (arm length, tube OD/wall thickness, specific geometry) using 6061 aluminum or carbon fiber, 2) Specific elastic band specs (latex tubing diameter, active length, number of strands) targeting ~550N peak force at maximum draw, 3) Optimal draw length to maximize stored energy, 4) Projectile specifications (exact mass in grams, diameter, material), and 5) Expected stored energy in Joules and predicted kinetic energy output? I want a complete, buildable specification targeting maximum performance.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. This is where engineering moves from theory to application. Here is a complete, buildable specification set designed for maximum performance within the stated constraints.

**Design Philosophy:** This design uses a **compound pulley system** to achieve a long draw length with a manageable human force, maximizing the `x²` term in the energy equation. The frame is optimized for high stiffness and low weight.

### 1. Frame Specifications

The frame is a fixed, ground-supported structure. The operator will pull back the launching arm, which runs on a linear bearing or low-friction sleeve for consistency.

**Material:** **6061-T6 Aluminum** (selected for its excellent specific stiffness and manufacturability).
*   *Alternative:* A carbon fiber tube of similar diameter and wall thickness would save approximately 40% in weight (~1.8 kg total frame weight) but at significantly higher cost.

**Geometry:** A reinforced **Twin-Triangle** design for maximum torsional and bending rigidity.
*   **Base Width:** 0.5 m (for stability)
*   **Height:** 1.0 m (from ground to pivot point)
*   **Launch Arm Length:** 1.2 m (pivot to projectile cup)
*   **Draw Length:** 1.5 m (this is the critical distance the bands will be stretched)

**Tube Specifications:**
*   **Primary Members (Legs, Launch Arm):** **1.25" (31.75 mm) OD, 0.125" (3.17 mm) Wall Thickness** round tubing.
*   **Cross-Braces (Triangulation):** **1.0" (25.4 mm) OD, 0.125" (3.17 mm) Wall Thickness** round tubing.
*   **Rationale:** This wall thickness is more than sufficient to handle the compressive and tensile loads without buckling or yielding. The moment of inertia of these tubes makes them extremely rigid for their weight. The total estimated frame weight is **~3.0 kg**.

### 2. Elastic Band Configuration

**Material:** **Natural Latex Rubber Tubing** (highest energy density and elasticity).

**Specification per Strand:**
*   **Outer Diameter (OD):** **25 mm** (This is a large, high-power tubing size)
*   **Wall Thickness:** **~3 mm**
*   **Unstretched (Relaxed) Length (`L₀`):** **0.25 m**
*   **Maximum Stretched Length (`L_max`):** **1.5 m** (equal to the draw length)
*   **Stretch Ratio (`λ`):** `L_max / L₀ = 1.5 / 0.25 = 6:1`

**Force Calculation:**
The force of a stretched rubber tube is given by a simplified model: `F ≈ k * (λ - 1)`, where `k` is a constant based on the material and cross-sectional area.
For 25mm OD, 3mm wall latex tubing, a typical `k` value is **~150 N per strand** at a 5:1 stretch ratio.
At our 6:1 ratio, force per strand is approximately `F_strand ≈ 150 N * (6/5) = 180 N`.

**Number of Strands:**
*   Target Peak Force: **550 N**
*   Number of Strands Required: `550 N / 180 N ≈ 3.05`
*   **Specification:** Use **4 strands** in parallel.
*   **Total Peak Force:** `4 * 180 N = 720 N`
*   **Why over-spec?** The pulley system provides a 2:1 mechanical advantage. The force the operator must apply to hold the launcher at full draw is `720 N / 2 = 360 N`, which is well within the human limit and allows for comfortable aiming. The bands are capable of more force, ensuring maximum energy storage.

**Configuration:** The 4 strands will be arranged in a "V" or "X" pattern from the base of the frame to the ends of the launching arm, using the pulley system described next.

### 3. Pulley System & Draw Length

*   **Mechanical Advantage:** **2:1 System**. The cable attached to the projectile cup is routed through a pulley fixed at the base of the frame. This means the operator only pulls with **half the force** that is in the elastic bands, but must pull the rope **twice the distance** the projectile cup moves.
*   **Draw Length (`x`):** **1.5 meters**. This is the distance the *projectile cup* travels. The operator must pull the rope **3.0 meters**.
*   **This long draw length is the key to high energy storage.**

---

### 4. Projectile Specifications

**Optimal Mass Calculation:**
The goal is to have the projectile absorb all the available energy over the full acceleration distance.

*   Estimated Stored Energy (`U`): ~540 J (see Section 5 below).
*   Assumed Efficiency (`η`): 75%
*   Expected Kinetic Energy (`KE`): `0.75 * 540 J = 405 J`
*   To achieve this KE, `m = (2 * KE) / v²`. However, `v` is also unknown.
*   The more accurate method is to use the launcher's characteristic. For a long-draw, high-force launcher, a heavier projectile is better. The optimal mass is typically found where the launch time is roughly equal to the time it takes for the band to contract. For this design, a mass between **350g and 450g** is optimal.

**Final Spec:**
*   **Mass:** **400 g** (±25g for tuning)
*   **Material:** **1018 Steel** (dense, cheap, durable)
*   **Shape:** **Cylindrical** with a shallow concave base to engage securely with the projectile cup.
*   **Dimensions:** Approximately **38 mm diameter x 65 mm length**.
*   **Surface:** Smooth, with minimal friction against the launch guide.

### 5. Energy Output Prediction

**A) Stored Elastic Potential Energy (`U`):**
The bands are non-linear, but we can approximate the stored energy by calculating the average force over the draw distance.
*   Peak Force: **720 N**
*   Force at start of draw (pre-load): ~50 N
*   **Average Force (`F_avg`):** ~(720 + 50)/2 ≈ **385 N**
*   **Stored Energy (`U`):** `F_avg * draw_length = 385 N * 1.5 m = 577.5 J`

A more accurate method is the integral `∫ F(x)dx`. Using the rubber model `F = k(λ - 1)`:
`U = k * L₀ * [ (λ_final - 1)² / 2 ]` for a linear approximation.
For 4 strands: `U = 4 * 150 N * 0.25m * [ (6 - 1)² / 2 ] = 4 * 150 * 0.25 * (12.5) = 4 * 468.75 = 537.5 J`

We'll use **~540 J** as our expected stored energy.

**B) Predicted Kinetic Energy Output (`KE`):**
*   **Efficiency (`η`):** **75%** (Accounting for ~15% hysteresis loss in the latex, ~5% friction in the pulley/guide, and ~5% frame vibration/losses).
*   **Final Kinetic Energy:** `KE = η * U = 0.75 * 540 J = 405 Joules`
*   **Projectile Velocity:** `v = sqrt( (2 * KE) / m ) = sqrt( (2 * 405) / 0.4 ) = sqrt(2025) = 45 m/s**

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
1.  **Safety:** 405 J is a tremendous amount of energy. This system is **lethal**. All operations must be done with extreme caution behind a ballistic shield. The projectile must never be aimed at any person or anything valuable.
2.  **Tuning:** The specified projectile mass (400g) is the theoretical optimum. You **must test and tune** this. Create projectiles in 25g increments from 300g to 500g and see which one yields the highest measured velocity/KE.
3.  **Band Sourcing:** Source your latex tubing from a supplier that provides force-extension data. The `k=150N` value is an estimate; real-world values will vary. Characterize your actual bands.
4.  **Friction Reduction:** Use a **Teflon-lined** or **Delrin** sleeve for the launch arm to slide on. Use high-quality, low-friction pulleys for the cable. Every fraction of a Joule saved in friction adds to your final score.
5.  **Anchor Points:** The band anchors and pulley anchor must be extremely robust. Use through-bolts with large washers, not screws.
