Of course. This is an excellent and critical safety question.

Yes, **this specific "Hyperion Mark I" design would be profoundly unsafe** with rock or steel projectiles, or indeed with any projectile. Furthermore, **it would exceed the 60J safety cap by a massive margin,** even with the intended lightweight projectile.

Here is a breakdown of why.

---

### **1. The Design Itself is Inherently Unsafe**

The "Max Power Variant" was designed by ignoring all safety margins and material limits to find a theoretical maximum. It is, by definition, **a single-use device operating at the point of catastrophic failure.**

*   **Energy Storage:** The elastic bands are pre-tensioned to their fracture limit. Any imperfection in the latex, the frame, or the release mechanism would cause the stored energy to be released uncontrollably, likely sending shrapnel backwards towards the operator.
*   **Forces Involved:** The 6,000 N (1,350 lbf) force is immense. This is more than enough to:
    *   Shatter the proposed carbon fiber frame.
    *   Shear the tungsten carbide axle.
    *   Rip the band attachments from the frame.
    There is no safe way for a human to be near this device when it is armed.

### **2. Projectile Choice Exacerbates the Danger**

While the design is already unsafe, the projectile choice makes the potential consequences even worse.

| Projectile Type | Mass (Est.) | Kinetic Energy (KE) at **740 m/s** | Why It's More Dangerous |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intended: Silicon Nitride Ceramic** | **~5.5 g** | **KE = ½ * 0.0055 kg * (740 m/s)² ≈ 1,500 J** | The high velocity makes it incredibly dangerous, but the low mass means it might disintegrate upon impact with a hard target, dissipating some energy. |
| **Steel Ball Bearing (½")** | **~16.5 g** | **KE = ½ * 0.0165 kg * (740 m/s)² ≈ 4,520 J** | **75x over the safety cap.** The high mass and durability make it a armor-piercing round. It would retain lethal energy over a long distance and penetrate most backstops. |
| **Rock (Approx. ½" sphere)** | **~3.5 g** | **KE = ½ * 0.0035 kg * (740 m/s)² ≈ 960 J** | **16x over the safety cap.** Its irregular shape would cause unpredictable, tumbling flight and could shatter on impact, creating fragmentation risks. |

**Conclusion on Energy:** All projectiles result in kinetic energies **orders of magnitude** over the **60 Joule** safety cap. A 60J cap is designed for non-lethal, low-energy devices (e.g., a paintball gun fires a projectile with ~12J). The energies calculated here (1,500J - 4,500J) are in the range of **high-powered rifle cartridges** and are unequivocally lethal.

### **3. Why the Lighter Projectile is "Best" (The Lesser of Three Evils)**

In this purely theoretical and dangerous scenario, the lightweight ceramic sphere was chosen for one reason: **to maximize acceleration and velocity for the contest's "distance" metric.**
*   Since `a = F/m`, a lighter projectile accelerates faster.
*   Since `Kinetic Energy = ½mv²`, achieving a higher velocity (`v`) is the primary goal for distance.

However, from a safety perspective, it is still catastrophically dangerous. The choice of a lighter projectile doesn't make the device safe; it just changes the *type* of hazard from a high-mass impact to an extremely high-velocity impact.

### **Summary for Your Presentation:**

You could address this in your one-pager with a clear disclaimer:

> **"Safety Note & Theoretical Context:** The 'Hyperion' design operates at the absolute limits of material science and energy density. The calculated kinetic energy output of **~1,500 Joules** is **25 times** the stated 60J safety cap. This design is presented solely as a theoretical exercise to explore the upper bounds of performance. Any physical implementation would be inherently unstable and lethally dangerous. This highlights the critical engineering trade-off between ultimate performance and mandatory safety constraints, a balance that must be carefully managed in any real-world build."

This disclaimer shows the judges you have not only considered performance but also deeply understand the safety implications, even in a theoretical context. It turns a dangerously optimized design into a sophisticated discussion on engineering ethics and constraints.
