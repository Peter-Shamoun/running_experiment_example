USER PROMPT:
This framework is excellent. Now I need to translate this into a concrete design specification. Let's target a high-performance design optimized for maximum KE output. Can you specify: 1) Exact frame dimensions (arm length, fork gap, tube diameter/thickness) using a high-stiffness material like 7075 aluminum or carbon fiber, 2) Specific band configuration (material type, diameter/thickness, unstretched length, number of strands) that maximizes stored energy while keeping peak force around 500-600N, 3) Optimal draw length to maximize the stretch ratio, and 4) Projectile specifications (mass targeting maximum allowed ~80g, material, diameter). I want to push the boundaries of what's achievable within human operating limits.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. This is an excellent challenge. Translating the theoretical framework into a concrete, high-performance specification is key to winning. Here is a detailed design specification targeting maximum kinetic energy output while adhering to the human operability constraint.

### 1. Frame Design & Dimensions

The frame's sole purpose is to be an infinitely rigid reaction structure. Any flexure is stolen energy.

*   **Material:** **Carbon Fiber Tubing**. This is the optimal choice. Its tensile modulus (E) of ~230 GPa and exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratio far surpasses even 7075 aluminum (~72 GPa). It is worth the cost for this application.
    *   *Alternative:* If cost is prohibitive, use **7075-T6 Aluminum Tubing**. It is still an excellent, high-performance material.
*   **Arm Tube Specification:**
    *   **Outer Diameter (OD):** **32 mm** (Larger diameter dramatically increases the second moment of area, I, which resists bending).
    *   **Wall Thickness:** **1.5 mm** (This provides an excellent balance of stiffness and low weight for both CF and Al).
    *   **Arm Length (Pivot to Band Anchor):** **450 mm**. This provides a good mechanical advantage for the operator. The longer arm allows for a longer draw length within a manageable form factor.
*   **Fork Geometry:**
    *   **Included Angle:** **90 degrees**. This provides a wide, stable base for the bands, minimizing sideways torque on the frame and ensuring symmetrical force application.
    *   **Fork Gap (Width at Anchor Points):** The distance between the two band anchor points is calculated as: `2 * (Arm Length * sin(θ/2)) = 2 * (0.45m * sin(45°)) ≈ 2 * (0.45 * 0.707) ≈ 0.636 meters`.
*   **Cross-Brace:**
    *   **Critical.** This prevents the arms from flexing inward. It must be installed.
    *   **Material:** Same as arms (32mm OD, 1.5mm wall).
    *   **Position:** Place it **100 mm** back from the band anchor points on each arm.
    *   **Length:** The distance between the arms at this point is `2 * ((0.45m - 0.1m) * sin(45°)) ≈ 2 * (0.35 * 0.707) ≈ 0.495 meters`.
    *   **Specification:** **Make the cross-brace 495 mm long.** Securely bond and bolt it to the arms.

### 2. Band Configuration: Maximizing Stored Energy

This is the heart of the system. We will target a peak force of **550 N** (~124 lbs), which is at the upper limit of what a strong adult can reliably manage using two hands and bracing the device against their body.

*   **Material:** **½-inch (12.7 mm) OD Latex Rubber Tubing**. This is a standard high-performance size with a high energy density.
*   **Characterized Spring Constant:** For calculation, we'll assume an effective `k_eff` of **110 N/m per strand** at high stretch ratios (λ > 5). *(You must verify this with your specific tubing by conducting a pull test!)*
*   **Target Stretch Ratio (λ):** **5.5**. This is aggressive but achievable with high-quality latex and proper design. It maximizes the `(ΔL)^2` term in the energy equation.
*   **Draw Length (`L_draw`):** **825 mm**. This is a function of your frame size and arm length. The pouch must be able to travel this far back.
*   **Unstretched Length (`L₀`):** This is derived from our target λ.
    *   `L₀ = L_draw / λ = 825 mm / 5.5 = 150 mm`
*   **Number of Strands (`n`):** This is calculated to hit our peak force target.
    *   `F_peak = n * k_eff * ΔL`
    *   We need to solve for `n`: `n = F_peak / (k_eff * ΔL)`
    *   `ΔL` is the *active stretch*, which is `L_draw - L_pre`. We will pre-stretch the bands to `λ_pre = 1.25` at rest.
    *   `L_pre = λ_pre * L₀ = 1.25 * 150mm = 187.5 mm`
    *   `ΔL = 825 mm - 187.5 mm = 637.5 mm = 0.6375 m`
    *   `n = 550 N / (110 N/m * 0.6375 m)`
    *   `n = 550 / 70.125 ≈ 7.84`
*   **Specification:** **Use 8 strands of tubing** (4 per side). This gives a slight buffer (`n=8` yields `F_peak = 8 * 110 * 0.6375 ≈ 561 N`).

**Total Predicted Stored Energy (`U_e`):**
`U_e ≈ 1/2 * k_total * (ΔL)^2`
`k_total = n * k_eff = 8 * 110 = 880 N/m`
`U_e ≈ 1/2 * 880 * (0.6375)^2 ≈ 1/2 * 880 * 0.406 ≈ 178.6 Joules`

This is the energy stored in the bands. System efficiency will reduce the KE delivered to the projectile.

### 3. Projectile Specification

Your goal is to capture as much of the `U_e` as possible.

*   **Mass:** **80 grams**. Use the entire mass allowance. This improves energy transfer efficiency.
*   **Diameter:** **20 mm**. This is chosen to match a standard barrel size.
*   **Length:** ~80-100 mm (to be determined by density of materials).
*   **Construction:**
    *   **Core:** **Tungsten Putty** or **small lead shot** mixed with epoxy. Tungsten has the highest density (~19 g/cm³), allowing you to make a smaller, more aerodynamic projectile.
    *   **Body:** **3D Printed Aerodynamic Shell** (e.g., using Nylon or ABS). Design a low-drag **ogive nose cone** shape.
    *   **Base:** Flat to ensure a clean push from the pouch. Consider a very slight **boat-tail** design to reduce base drag.
*   **Barrel:**
    *   **Material:** **Carbon Fiber Tube** (ideal for low friction).
    *   **Inner Diameter:** **21 mm** (to provide a ~0.5mm clearance around the 20mm projectile).
    *   **Length:** **750 mm**. Shorter than the draw length to ensure the projectile is accelerated before the pouch reaches the end of its travel.

**Final Critical Note: Verification is Key.** The calculated **561 N (126 lbs) pull force is extreme**. You must build a force gauge and test your specific bands. If the force is too high, slightly increase `L₀` (e.g., to 160mm for λ=5.16) to reduce the force. The trade-off between force and stretch ratio is the core of your optimization problem.

This design pushes the boundaries of human operability for maximum energy output. Prioritize safety—wear eye protection and ensure all components are rated well above the predicted forces. Good luck.
