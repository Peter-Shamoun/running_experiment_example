USER PROMPT:
This is fantastic detail! For my build specifications, I need to finalize exact parameters: (1) For the frame - if I go with 7075 aluminum tubing, what exact wall thickness and tube diameter for the arms? What's the exact length and dimensions of the cross-brace? (2) For the bands - if using 8 strands of 1/2

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. This is where we move from general principles to specific, actionable engineering specifications. This is an excellent project.

Here are the exact parameters and calculations for a high-performance, human-operable design based on your constraints.

### 1. Frame Specifications (7075-T6 Aluminum)

The goal is maximum rigidity with minimal weight. 7075-T6 aluminum is an excellent choice for its high strength-to-weight ratio.

*   **Arm Tubing:**
    *   **Outer Diameter (OD):** **25 mm (1 inch)**. This provides a large moment of inertia, which is critical for resisting bending.
    *   **Wall Thickness:** **1.5 mm (0.065 inches)**. This is a standard thickness for 25mm OD 7075 tubing. It provides an excellent balance of strength and light weight. Thicker walls (e.g., 2mm) add marginal stiffness for a significant weight penalty.
    *   **Arm Length (from pivot to band anchor):** **400 mm**. This provides a good mechanical advantage for the operator. Longer arms would increase leverage but make the device unwieldy and more prone to flexure.

*   **Cross-Brace:**
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent the two arms from flexing inward (like a wishbone) under the immense tension of the bands. This flexure is a major source of energy loss.
    *   **Material:** Same **25mm OD x 1.5mm wall 7075 tubing** for consistency.
    *   **Length:** This is determined by the geometry.
        *   With an **80°** included angle between the arms and a **400mm** arm length, the distance between the band anchor points is approximately **2 * (400mm * sin(40°)) ≈ 514mm**.
        *   The cross-brace should be mounted as far forward as possible for maximum effectiveness. Mount it **100mm** back from the band anchor points on each arm.
        *   At this point, the distance between the arms is smaller. The exact length of the cross-brace (`L_brace`) is calculated as:
            `L_brace = 2 * ( (400mm - 100mm) * sin(40°) ) ≈ 2 * (300 * 0.643) ≈ 386mm`
    *   **Recommendation:** **Make the cross-brace 380 mm long.** This allows a few millimeters for mounting hardware. It should be bolted (not just glued) to the arms using high-strength aluminum brackets.

*   **Main Body/Stock:** Use a larger diameter tube for the main grip (e.g., **32mm OD x 1.5mm wall**) to provide a comfortable and robust handle. This should be welded or securely bolted to the arms.

### 2. Elastic Band Specifications (8 strands of 1/2" Latex Tubing)

This is the heart of the system. The stored energy must be maximized while keeping the pull force within human limits.

*   **Band Type:** **½-inch (12.7 mm) OD Latex Rubber Tubing** (often sold as "surgical tubing" or "thera-tubing"). Ensure it's pure latex for the best energy density.
*   **Number of Strands:** **8 strands** (4 per side of the Y).
*   **Unstretched Length (`L₀`):** This is the most critical calculation. We will size it based on a target **stretch ratio (λ) of 5.0**.
    *   Let's define the **draw length (`L_draw`)**. This is how far you pull the pouch back from its resting position. A longer draw stores more energy. For a handheld device, a draw length of **800 mm (0.8 m)** is aggressive but achievable with good technique and a shoulder stock.
    *   Therefore, the unstretched length per strand is:
        `L₀ = L_draw / λ = 0.8 m / 5.0 = 0.16 m = 16 cm`
*   **Pre-Stretch:** Mount the bands so they are already slightly taut at rest. Aim for an initial pre-stretch of **λ_pre = 1.2**. This means the distance from the pouch's rest position to the band anchor on the frame should be **1.2 * L₀ = 1.2 * 0.16m = 0.192 m**.

**Pull Force Calculation (Is it Human-Operable?):**
The force constant (`k`) for ½" latex tubing is approximately **100 N/m per strand** at high stretch ratios (this is a tested average; you *must* verify this with your specific tubing).
*   Force at full draw (`F_draw`) = Number of Strands * `k` * (`L_draw` - `L_pre`)
*   `L_pre` is the pre-stretched length = `λ_pre * L₀ = 1.2 * 0.16m = 0.192m`
*   `F_draw` = 8 strands * 100 N/m * (0.8m - 0.192m)
*   `F_draw` = 8 * 100 * 0.608 = **486 Newtons**
*   **Convert to lbs: 486 N / 4.45 ≈ 110 lbs of force.**

**This is a peak force of 110 lbs.** This is manageable for a strong operator using two hands and bracing the stock against their body, but it is the absolute upper limit of "human-operable." If this is too high, reduce the stretch ratio to **λ=4.5**, which would increase `L₀` to ~18cm and drop the peak force to roughly **90 lbs**.

### 3. Projectile & Launch System

*   **Projectile Mass:** **80 grams.** Use every gram of your mass allowance.
*   **Projectile Design:**
    *   **Shape:** **Ogive (bullet-shaped) nose cone.** 3D print this in a strong material like ABS or nylon. Fill the internal cavity with weight (e.g., clay, tungsten putty, small steel shot) to achieve the exact 80g mass.
    *   **Base:** A flat base that makes a clean seal inside the barrel.
    *   **Diameter:** To be determined by your barrel.
*   **Barrel:**
    *   **Material:** **Carbon fiber tube** (ideal for low friction and rigidity) or **aluminum tube** (more affordable).
    *   **Inner Diameter (ID):** **~22 mm**. This allows for a ~20mm projectile with a small tolerance.
    *   **Length:** **600-700 mm**. This should be slightly shorter than your draw length to ensure the projectile is fully accelerated before it leaves the barrel. The bands must be able to pull the pouch back this far.

*   **Pouch & Release:**
    *   **Pouch:** Use a flexible but strong material like **nylon webbing** or **thin leather**. It must grip the projectile firmly without deformation.
    *   **Release Mechanism:** This is critical. A **rotating sear mechanism** (like a crossbow trigger) is highly recommended. It should be made from **hardened steel** to withstand the forces without deformation. The release must be *smooth* and *instantaneous* to avoid any energy loss.

**Pro Tip for Safety and Consistency:** Build a **cocking aid**. This could be a simple rope and pulley system ("rope cocker") that allows you to use your legs and full body weight to draw the bands, ensuring a consistent and safe draw every time. This is often within the rules of "human-operable" as long as it's not a mechanical advantage system left on the device.

Good luck with the build. Measure everything twice and prioritize safety—these forces are no joke
