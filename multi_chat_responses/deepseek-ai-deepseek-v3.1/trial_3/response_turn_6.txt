USER PROMPT:
Perfect. One last critical component - the pouch system that connects the bands to the projectile. Can you specify: 1) What material should the pouch be made from? 2) What dimensions (active length between band connection points)? 3) How thick should the material be? 4) How should it attach to the bands (the connection method between the 8 rubber tubing strands and the pouch)? This is the critical interface for energy transfer.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. The pouch is the critical interface that transfers all the stored energy from the elastic bands to the projectile. A failure here means total energy loss, and poor design can introduce significant inefficiencies. Here is a detailed specification for a high-performance pouch system.

### 1. Pouch Material

The material must have high tensile strength, extremely low stretch, high abrasion resistance, and be flexible.

*   **Primary Recommendation:** **Nylon Webbing** (Tubular or Flat).
    *   **Type:** **1-inch (25mm) wide, Type III Mil-Spec (e.g., MIL-W-43668) Nylon Webbing**. This is the same material used in climbing harnesses and heavy-duty luggage. It has a tensile strength of **>4,000 kg (≈8,800 lbs)**, which is orders of magnitude above our requirement, ensuring no risk of failure.
    *   **Why Nylon?** It has a very low elongation (stretch) under load—typically only 2-3% at its working load. This is critical; a stretchy pouch would act like a second, inefficient elastic band, absorbing energy that should go to the projectile.
*   **Alternative:** **UHMWPE (Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene) Webbing** (e.g., Dyneema/Spectra). This is even stronger and has virtually zero stretch, but it can be more slippery and harder to knot securely.

### 2. Pouch Dimensions & Design

The pouch must cradle the projectile securely and provide robust attachment points for the bands.

*   **Overall Design:** A "**U-shaped sling**" or "**cradle**" that wraps around the bottom and sides of the projectile.
*   **Width:** The webbing itself is **1 inch (25mm) wide**. The total width of the pouch should match the expected spread of the bands to ensure force is applied evenly across the projectile's base.
    *   **Recommendation:** **150 mm** wide. This allows the 4 bands on each side to be grouped slightly without being bunched on top of each other.
*   **Pocket Depth:** The "pocket" that cradles the projectile must be deep enough to hold it securely without risk of it slipping out during the draw or acceleration.
    *   **Recommendation:** **100 mm** deep.
*   **Active Length (Between Connection Points):** This is a critical dimension that affects band alignment. The distance between the two points where the band groups attach should be wide enough to promote a clean, symmetric pull.
    *   **Recommendation:** **120 - 140 mm**. This ensures the force vectors from the left and right band groups converge nicely on the projectile's center of mass.

### 3. Material Thickness

Thickness relates to durability and rigidity.

*   **Recommendation:** **~2 mm**. Standard 1-inch nylon webbing has a thickness in this range. This is ideal:
    *   It is thick enough to be highly durable and resist wear from the bands and projectile.
    *   It is thin enough to remain flexible and form a tight, secure cradle around the projectile without adding significant mass.

### 4. Attachment Method: Bands to Pouch

This is the most crucial detail. The connection must be absolutely secure, distribute load evenly, and must not slip or chafe the bands.

*   **Method: ** **Direct Tying with a Secure, Low-Bulk Knot.**
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  **Group the Bands:** Do not attach all 8 bands to a single point. Group the **4 strands for the left side** together and the **4 strands for the right side** together.
    2.  **Create a Loop:** For each group of 4 strands, pass the ends of the tubing through themselves to create a simple loop. Ensure the bands are all of equal length within the group.
    3.  **Tie to Pouch:** Use a **Double Fisherman's Knot** (or a **Zeppelin Bend**) to tie the loop of the band group directly to a corresponding loop of webbing on the pouch.
        *   **Why this works:** These knots are designed to hold under immense, dynamic loads (they are used in climbing) and will not slip. They remain secure even after repeated loading and unloading.
        *   **Avoid Metal:** Do not use carabiners, rings, or other hard metal connectors. They add weight, create a point of impact that can damage the bands upon release, and can create unwanted noise and vibration.

*   **Pouch Construction:**
    1.  Take a length of webbing and fold it into the U-shaped cradle.
    2.  At each end, create a strong loop by folding the webbing back on itself and **sewing it with high-strength nylon thread** (e.g., using a bar-tack stitch pattern). This creates the two attachment points.
    3.  The knots from the band groups will attach directly to these sewn loops.

                                                          |
                                                    [Projectile]
                                                          |
                                                      (Webbing)
                                                          |

This method ensures a direct, robust, and lightweight connection that maximizes energy transfer. Before final competition, thoroughly test the pouch and knots under full load multiple times to ensure security and identify any wear.
