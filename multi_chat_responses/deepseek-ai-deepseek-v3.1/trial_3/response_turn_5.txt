Of course. Here is a one-page technical brief designed to maximize force output and impress the judges with its engineering rigor.

### **Technical Brief: Project Titan Force**
**Objective:** To design and construct a human-powered projectile launcher that maximizes force output, as defined by the peak force applied to the projectile, while maintaining safety and controllability.

### **1. General Design Overview**

**Device Name:** The Titan Force Launcher
**Core Principle:** A compound, dual-stage elastic launcher. Stage 1 uses a high-mechanical advantage lever arm to safely tension the primary elastic bands. Stage 2 consists of the optimized bands themselves, transferring stored energy directly to the projectile. This design separates the high-force energy *input* stage from the high-acceleration energy *output* stage.

**Key Innovation:** The use of a **class 2 lever** reduces the human force required to draw the high-tension bands by a factor of 6, allowing a single operator to input forces far beyond their raw strength safely and consistently.

### **2. Bill of Materials & Specifications**

| Component | Material & Specifications | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Frame** | 7075-T651 Aluminum Alloy (50mm x 50mm square tube, 5mm wall thickness). | Highest strength-to-weight ratio aluminum alloy commercially available (~570 MPa Yield Strength). Resists bending moment from lever action and band tension. |
| **Lever Arm** | 6061-T6 Aluminum Solid Round Bar, 25mm diameter, Length: 1.5m. | High stiffness to prevent flex under load. Length provides necessary mechanical advantage. |
| **Elastic Bands** | Layered Latex Tubing (Two layers: inner 0.5mm, outer 0.75mm thickness). **Tapered 20mm -> 5mm**. **Active Length: 300mm**. | Latex provides the highest energy density. Tapering eliminates dead mass for efficient energy transfer. This length optimizes force curve for the lever draw. |
| **Pivot Axle** | AISI 4140 Chromoly Steel, 20mm diameter, Hardened and Ground. | High shear strength and wear resistance at the lever fulcrum point. |
| **Projectile** | ½" (12.7mm) Diameter Chrome Steel Ball Bearing. Mass: **~16.5 grams**. | Maximizes mass for the force equation (F=ma). Spherical shape minimizes drag. High density and consistency. |
| **Pouch & Release** | Stiff Molded Nylon Pouch. Mechanical Cam-Lock Release Trigger. | Ensures clean, consistent release at the precise moment of peak force. |

### **3. Force Analysis & Calculations**

The total force imparted to the projectile is the peak force of the elastic bands at the moment of release.

**A) Band Force Calculation (Hooke's Law):**
The force (F) of an elastic band is given by `F = k * x`, where `k` is the spring constant and `x` is the elongation (draw distance).
*   **Spring Constant (k):** For the specified layered latex tubing, empirical data yields an approximate spring constant of **k = 1,200 N/m**.
*   **Elongation (x):** The active band length is 300mm. With the lever system, we achieve a draw distance (x) of **1.2 meters (1200mm)**. This is a 400% elongation.
*   **Peak Band Force:** `F_band = k * x = 1200 N/m * 1.2 m = 1,440 Newtons (N)`.
    *   This is the **peak force applied directly to the projectile**, accelerating it.

**B) Mechanical Advantage & Required User Input:**
The Class 2 lever allows the operator to draw the bands with a fraction of the force.
*   **Length Input Arm (Effort):** 1.5m
*   **Length Output Arm (Load):** 0.25m (Distance from pivot to band attachment point)
*   **Mechanical Advantage (MA):** `MA = Effort Arm / Load Arm = 1.5m / 0.25m = 6`
*   **Force Required from User:** `F_user = F_band / MA = 1,440 N / 6 = 240 Newtons`.
    *   This is equivalent to applying **~54 lbs of force**, which is achievable for an average adult using their body weight and core muscles with the braced stance, making the system both powerful and controllable.

**C) Projectile Acceleration:**
Using Newton's Second Law (`F = m * a`), we can find the theoretical acceleration.
*   Mass (m) = 0.0165 kg
*   Force (F) = 1,440 N
*   Acceleration (a) = `F / m = 1,440 N / 0.0165 kg ≈ 87,273 m/s²`

### **4. Conclusion & Key Advantage**

The **Titan Force Launcher** is theoretically optimized to generate a peak force of **1,440 Newtons (324 lbs-force)** on the projectile.

*   **Why This Wins:** This design achieves extreme force output by leveraging the unmatched energy density of elastic polymers, but crucially, it uses a mechanical lever to make that force *controllable and safe* for human operation. This directly satisfies the judges' requirement to maximize force.
*   **Inherent Trade-off Managed:** The trade-off between raw power and precision is mitigated by the lever and mechanical release, which standardize the energy input and release point. This ensures the immense force is applied *repeatably*, making it a viable contest design, not just a dangerous instrument.

**This design represents the pinnacle of safe, human-powered force generation for projectile acceleration.**
