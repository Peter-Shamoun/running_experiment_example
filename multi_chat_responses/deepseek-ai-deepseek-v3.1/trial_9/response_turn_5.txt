### **Project: Titanoboa Mk.II - Force-Optimized Elastic Propulsion System**
**Objective:** To design and construct a human-powered projectile launcher that maximizes initial force output (F₀) on the projectile, ensuring supreme energy transfer efficiency and repeatability.

---

### **1. General Design Overview**
The Titanoboa Mk.II is a bench-rest, compound-class slingshot. Its design philosophy is to maximize the initial force (F₀) imparted to the projectile by optimizing the elastic energy storage system and minimizing all energy losses through an infinitely rigid frame and guided launch pathway. Human power is applied via a high-mechanical-advantage winch to draw the elastic bands to a precise, pre-set length.

### **2. Bill of Materials & Specifications**

| Component | Material & Key Properties | Critical Measurements | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Frame & Base Plate** | 6061-T6 Aluminum Plate (σ_y = 275 MPa, E = 69 GPa) | 100 cm x 50 cm x 2 cm thick. Mass: ~27 kg. | The mass and rigidity prevent recoil and frame flex, ensuring all elastic energy is transferred to the projectile. The high yield strength (σ_y) guarantees integrity under extreme loads. |
| **Elastic Band System** | Layered Natural Latex Flat Bands (TheraBand Gold®). Tensile Strength: ~30 MPa. | **Width:** 3 inches (7.62 cm) per band. **Active Length (L₀):** 30 cm. **Configuration:** 4 layers per side. **Total Draw Length (Δx):** 100 cm (70 cm stretch). | Width and layering maximize the cross-sectional area, dramatically increasing the spring constant (k). The draw length is the practical maximum for a human-powered winch, maximizing energy storage (E=½k(Δx)²). |
| **Projectile & Pouch** | **Projectile:** Precision 25.4mm (1") Diameter Chrome Steel Ball Bearing. **Mass:** 66.5g. **Pouch:** Kevlar-reinforced leather. | Projectile Mass: 0.0665 kg. | A high-mass projectile is essential for converting high force into high momentum. The spherical shape and smooth surface minimize energy losses to aerodynamics during the critical launch phase. |
| **Winch & Draw Guidance** | **Winch Drum:** Steel, mounted on sealed ball bearings. **Line:** Dyneema Synthetic Fiber (Yield Strength: 2.5 GPa). **Guide:** Hardened Steel Rails with Linear Ball Bearings. | **Drum Diameter:** 5 cm. **Handle Length:** 25 cm. **Mechanical Advantage:** 10:1. | The high mechanical advantage allows a human to generate the immense force required to draw the bands. The low-friction guidance system ensures a perfectly linear draw, critical for repeatability. |

### **3. Force Production Calculations**

The total force is derived from the elastic bands. The initial force (F₀) required to *hold* the projectile at rest at full draw is equal to the combined tension force from all bands.

**Step 1: Calculate Spring Constant (k) for a Single Band Layer**
The formula for the spring constant of a flat latex band is:
\[ k_{layer} = \frac{E \cdot A}{L_0} \]
Where:
*   **E** = Elastic Modulus of Latex ≈ **1.0 x 10⁶ Pa** (at typical strain rates)
*   **A** = Cross-sectional Area = Width * Thickness = **0.0762 m * 0.001 m = 7.62 x 10⁻⁵ m²**
*   **L₀** = Original unstretched length = **0.3 m**

\[ k_{layer} = \frac{(1.0 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa}) \cdot (7.62 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2)}{0.3 \, \text{m}} \approx 254 \, \text{N/m} \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Spring Constant (k_total)**
The system uses 4 layers per side, and both sides pull in parallel. Springs in parallel have an additive effect.
\[ k_{side} = 4 \cdot k_{layer} = 4 \cdot 254 \, \text{N/m} = 1,016 \, \text{N/m} \]
\[ k_{total} = 2 \cdot k_{side} = 2 \cdot 1,016 \, \text{N/m} = 2,032 \, \text{N/m} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Initial Force (F₀) at Full Draw**
Force in a spring is given by Hooke's Law: **F = k · Δx**
Where **Δx** is the stretch (70 cm = 0.7 m).
\[ F_0 = k_{total} \cdot \Delta x = 2,032 \, \text{N/m} \cdot 0.7 \, \text{m} = 1,422.4 \, \text{N} \]

**Total Initial Force Output: ≈ 1,422 Newtons**
*(This is the force required to hold the projectile at rest. Upon release, this force accelerates the projectile.)*

### **4. Key Trade-offs & Academic Rationale**
*   **Portability vs. Performance:** The Titanoboa is a heavy, fixed-platform device. This trade-off is essential to achieve the rigidity required for maximum force transfer and repeatability, the contest's primary metrics.
*   **Cycle Time vs. Force Output:** The high-mechanical-advantage winch makes the draw process slow, but this is the necessary cost of allowing a human to safely load a system generating over 1.4 kN of force.
*   **Material Fatigue:** The latex bands are a consumable component. Their performance will degrade after repeated use at maximum draw. This is an accepted trade-off for achieving peak theoretical performance during judged runs.

**Conclusion:** The Titanoboa Mk.II is designed from first principles to maximize the initial force imparted to a projectile. Its 1.42 kN output is a direct result of optimizing the material properties, cross-sectional area, and draw length of its elastic energy storage system, all mounted upon a structure engineered to be devoid of energy-sapping flex. It represents the pinnacle of theoretical force optimization in a human-powered launcher.
