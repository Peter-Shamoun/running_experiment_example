Of course. This is an excellent and critical question that gets to the heart of why theoretical designs must be tempered by real-world constraints.

**The short answer is: Yes, it would be profoundly unsafe. Using a standard rock or steel projectile would not just exceed the 60J safety cap—it would utterly obliterate it by several orders of magnitude, creating a potentially lethal device.**

Here is a detailed breakdown of why.

### **1. The Fatal Flaw: Energy is Dictated by the Launcher, Not the Projectile.**

The HYPERION variant is designed to store a massive and fixed amount of **elastic potential energy** in its bands, calculated by the formula:
\[ E_{elastic} = \frac{1}{2} k_{total} (\Delta x)^2 \]

Using the values from the HYPERION design:
\[ E_{elastic} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20,320 \, \text{N/m} \times (1.2 \, \text{m})^2 \approx 14,630 \, \text{Joules} \]

This is the total energy stored in the drawn bands. In an ideal, lossless system, this energy is transferred into the kinetic energy of the projectile.

*   **The 60J safety cap is surpassed by a factor of over 243.** This energy level is comparable to a .50 caliber rifle round and is unequivocally lethal.

### **2. The Effect of Changing Projectile Mass**

The mass of the projectile doesn't change the *total energy* released; it changes *how that energy is distributed* between velocity and momentum.

*   **With the 5g Tungsten Projectile:** As calculated, the energy is ~14.6 kJ, resulting in an extreme velocity of ~2,400 m/s.
*   **With a 66.5g Steel Ball Bearing (1-inch diameter):** The total energy is still ~14.6 kJ, but it is now given to a much heavier object.
    *   The velocity would be much lower: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times E}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 14,630}{0.0665}} \approx 663 \, \text{m/s} \).
    *   While slower than the tungsten projectile, **663 m/s is still hypersonic** (nearly Mach 2) and carries 14.6 kJ of energy.

*   **With a Roughly Shaped 100g Rock:** The energy remains ~14.6 kJ.
    *   Velocity would be: \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 14,630}{0.1}} \approx 540 \, \text{m/s} \).
    *   This is still supersonic and devastatingly powerful.

**Conclusion on Projectile Type:** Swapping the projectile only changes the projectile's velocity, not the total destructive energy of the system. Any projectile launched from this device would be dangerously far above the 60J limit.

### **Why This Design is Inherently Unsafe (Beyond the Energy Cap)**

1.  **Catastrophic Failure Risk:** The bands are stressed to 95% of their tensile strength. Any minor flaw—a nick in the latex, a imperfect clamp, a weak point in the rock—would cause instantaneous failure. This could send high-velocity shrapnel (the broken bands or the projectile) in unpredictable directions.
2.  **Structural Integrity:** The frame, while made of titanium, has a *zero safety factor*. The forces involved (24.4 kN) are immense. A slight misalignment or material flaw could cause a structural failure of the forks or the guide system.
3.  **Human Factor:** The 20:1 mechanical advantage winch is necessary to generate the force, but it also means the operator is slowly and precariously tensioning a device holding the energy equivalent of a high-powered rifle shot. A slip, a broken winch handle, or a trigger malfunction could have catastrophic consequences.

**Final Verdict:**

The HYPERION "Max Power" design is a purely theoretical exercise to explore the outer limits of physics. **It is fundamentally and lethally unsafe by any real-world standard.** It is designed to prove a point on paper, not to be constructed or operated.

The 60J safety cap exists precisely to prevent the construction of such devices. This design, with its **14,600 Joules** of energy, violates that cap by 24,300%. Using a rock or steel ball would not make it safer; it would simply create a slower, heavier, and equally destructive projectile.
