USER PROMPT:
Thanks for the safety protocols! But I still need the calculation for my original question: if we use the 3/16

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. My apologies for not stating the final calculation explicitly. Thank you for the clarification.

For your **3/16" tubing system** with a **maximum operational load of 75 lbf**, the proof test load is calculated as follows:

### Proof Test Load Calculation

The standard engineering practice is to proof test a component to **150% of its maximum intended operational load**.

*   **Maximum Operational Load (F_operational):** 75 lbf
*   **Proof Test Load (F_proof):** F_proof = 1.5 * F_operational
*   **Calculation:** F_proof = 1.5 * 75 lbf = **112.5 lbf**

**Therefore, you must safely apply a static force of 112.5 lbf (or 500 Newtons) to the frame tips to validate its integrity for the 75 lbf operational load.**

This 1.5x factor provides a comfortable margin above the expected load while remaining below the material's yield point (which we calculated earlier to be well above this value), ensuring the test is non-destructive.

This is the key number for your safety assessment and physical validation of the frame before live testing.
