USER PROMPT:
Perfect analysis! One final question for our safety assessment: if we stick with the original 3/16

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. This is an absolutely critical step—validating the structural integrity of your frame before any live testing. A failure under load could be dangerous and set your project back significantly.

Here is a detailed, methodical procedure to safely proof-test your 3/16" tubing slingshot frame, verifying it can handle the calculated **75 lbf (333 N)** load with a significant safety margin.

### Non-Destructive Proof Test: Validating Frame Strength

This test applies a static load greater than the operational load to the frame without causing permanent deformation. This is a standard engineering practice for validating designs.

**Objective:** To apply a load of **~112.5 lbf (500 N)**—**1.5 times your max operational load**—to the fork tips and verify the frame shows no signs of yielding (permanent bending) or failure.

**Materials Needed:**
*   Your manufactured aluminum frame
*   **Spring scale or luggage scale** (rated for at least 120 lbf / 550 N)
*   **Strong cord** (e.g., paracord, nylon cord)
*   **Wooden dowel or a second fixed anchor point**
*   **Ruler or calipers** for precise measurement
*   **Permanent marker**

**Procedure:**

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** Before applying any load, use the ruler/calipers to meticulously measure and record the exact distance between the tips of the two forks. Mark this measurement point with the marker. Also, visually inspect the frame for any visible defects.

2.  **Create a Test Rig:**
    *   Securely fix the **handle** of your slingshot frame in a vise or clamp it firmly to a heavy, immovable workbench. Protect the finish of the handle with soft jaws or cardboard.
    *   Tie one end of your strong cord to the tip of one fork.
    *   Run the cord through the tip of the other fork and then to your spring scale.
    *   Anchor the other end of the spring scale to a second fixed point (like another vise or a heavy object) opposite the first. The goal is to create a system where you can pull the scale to tension the cord, which pulls the two forks together.

3.  **Apply the Load:**
    *   Slowly and steadily pull on the spring scale to tension the cord.
    *   **Carefully increase the force to 112.5 lbf (500 N).** Hold this load for at least 30 seconds.

4.  **Inspect and Measure:**
    *   **Visual Inspection:** While under load, closely observe the throat of the frame (where the forks meet the handle) for any signs of bending or deformation. Listen for any creaking or cracking sounds.
    *   **Dimensional Check:** After holding the load and then carefully releasing it, immediately re-measure the distance between the fork tips.
    *   **Permanent Set:** If the distance returns to exactly its original measurement, the frame has **passed the test** and has no permanent deformation. If the forks remain even slightly closer together, the frame has yielded and **failed**—you must redesign and use a thicker-walled material.

### Live-Fire Safety Protocol

Once the frame is validated, follow this protocol for all testing with the elastic bands.

**1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is Non-Negotiable:**
*   **ANSI Z87.1-rated safety glasses** must be worn by everyone in the testing area.
*   Consider a **full-face shield** for the person cocking and firing the device, especially during initial tests.
*   **Leather gloves** are recommended when handling the bands and cocking the device to protect hands from potential snap-back.

**2. Secure Testing Environment:**
*   Designate a clear **firing range** with a safe backstop (e.g., a large berm of sand, a ballistic rubber bullet trap rated for steel).
*   Ensure all team members and bystanders are behind the operator during testing.
*   **Never** fire the slingshot without a confirmed clear range and target area.

**3. Band Inspection Routine:**
*   **Before every single shot,** visually inspect the entire length of the surgical tubing for nicks, cracks, fraying, or weak spots. Latex can develop these flaws from wear and UV exposure.
*   **Stretch the bands slightly** and look for any micro-fractures. If you see any defect, **replace the bands immediately.** Do not risk it.

**4. Cocking and Firing Discipline:**
*   Always keep the slingshot pointed in a safe direction, especially when cocked.
*   Use a smooth, controlled motion to draw the pouch back to your anchor point. Avoid jerky movements that create uneven stress.
*   Establish a consistent **"ready to fire"** and **"fire"** command protocol among your team.

**5. Failure Mode Preparedness:**
*   The most likely point of failure is the **bands**, not the frame (after your proof test).
*   A band failure under tension will release energy violently and unpredictably. This is why eye and face protection is critical. The pouch or bands could snap back towards the user's face or body.

By rigorously following this proof-testing and safety protocol, you transform your design from a theoretical model into a trusted, physical system. This disciplined approach is exactly what engineering judges look for in a competition—it demonstrates a mature understanding that performance is meaningless without reliability and safety.
