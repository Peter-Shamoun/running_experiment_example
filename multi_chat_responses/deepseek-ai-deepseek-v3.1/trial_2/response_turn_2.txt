Of course. This is an excellent next-step question that gets right to the heart of engineering design: translating a concept into a dimensioned, functional system. Here is a breakdown for your analysis and presentation.

### **1. Ergonomic Scaling for an Average Adult (~5'10" / 1.78m)**

The goal is to position the high-torque input (the cranking motion) in the user's optimal strength zone to maximize energy input and ensure consistency between different operators.

*   **Crank Axle Height:** **~3.5 feet (1.07 meters) from the ground.**
    *   **Rationale:** This places the crank handle in a zone between the waist and mid-chest of a 5'10" user. This allows the operator to use their largest muscle groups (legs, back, core) by leaning into the crank with body weight, not just arm strength. It prevents awkward stooping or overhead cranking, which would reduce force output and repeatability.
*   **Base Footprint (Width x Length):** **~2.5 ft x 4 ft (0.75m x 1.2m).**
    *   **Rationale:** The width provides a stable stance for the user to apply force without tipping the device. The length ensures a low center of gravity and enough space to anchor the reaction forces from the launch mechanism, preventing the entire device from rocking forward upon release.
*   **Projectile Guide Rail Height:** **~4 feet (1.22 meters) at the breech, angling upwards.**
    *   **Rationale:** This is a comfortable height for loading the projectile without bending over, contributing to operational repeatability. The launch angle is adjusted separately via the calibrated mechanism at the pivot point.

### **2. Recommended Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum**

This is an ideal candidate for a *theoretical, academic* design focused on performance metrics.

*   **Key Properties:**
    *   **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** (Ultimate Tensile Strength ~310 MPa, Density ~2.7 g/cm³). This keeps the overall device weight manageable for transport between indoor/outdoor testing while maintaining rigidity.
    *   **Excellent Machinability:** Easily fabricated with standard university machine shop equipment (mills, lathes), which is important for a realistic design narrative.
    *   **Good Stiffness (Young's Modulus ~69 GPa):** Critical for minimizing frame flex under load. Any flexure would absorb energy that should go to the projectile and harm repeatability by changing the launch conditions slightly with each shot.
    *   **Corrosion Resistance:** Suitable for both indoor and brief outdoor environments.

### **3. Engineering Rationale & Basic Stress Considerations**

**Primary Load Case:** The worst-case stress scenario is likely **during the launch sequence**. The frame experiences:
1.  A **torque reaction** from the gearbox/flywheel as the crank is turned.
2.  A significant **impulsive shock load** through the guide rails and frame when the clutch releases and the torsion arm accelerates the projectile.

**Simplified Stress Analysis (For Presentation):**

*   **Assumption:** Model the main vertical support post as a **cantilevered beam** fixed at the base, with the load applied at the top from the launch mechanism.
*   **Load Estimation:** For a theoretical projectile mass of `m`, and a required launch acceleration `a`, the force `F` applied to the frame is `F ≈ m * a`. This force creates a **bending moment** `M` at the base of the support post: `M = F * h`, where `h` is the height to the application point.
*   **Stress Calculation:** The maximum **bending stress** `σ` in the rectangular support post is given by:
    `σ = (M * c) / I`
    where `c` is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber (half the thickness), and `I` is the area moment of inertia (for a rectangle, `I = (width * height³)/12`).

**Presentation Narrative:**

"In our analysis, we sized the main 6061-T6 aluminum support posts to be 50mm x 50mm square tubing with a 3mm wall thickness. Under a simulated worst-case launch force of [e.g., 500 N], we calculated a maximum bending stress of approximately **~40 MPa** at the base of the post."

"This is well below the **yield strength of 6061-T6 (~275 MPa)**, giving us a **factor of safety (FoS) of ~6.9**. This high FoS was chosen not because the load requires it, but to ensure **near-zero flexure**. Any bending would act as a non-linear spring, absorbing variable amounts of energy and destroying the repeatability that is key to our score. Our frame is designed to be **overly stiff, not just strong**, to guarantee consistent performance."

**Key Tradeoff to Mention:**

"The tradeoff for this high stiffness and low weight is **cost**. Aluminum is more expensive than steel. However, given the academic nature of this contest where performance metrics are paramount, and the fact this is a one-off design, we justify this choice for its superior specific stiffness and manufacturability."

This line of reasoning shows the judges you've thought critically about the intersection of mechanics, materials science, and the specific contest goals.
