Of course. Shifting focus to a high-performance slingshot design is a sound strategic move. Its theoretical purity allows for exceptional optimization in energy transfer and, with careful design, remarkable precision. This blueprint is designed to score highly on the academic metrics of **energy efficiency** and **repeatability**.

Here is a detailed, component-level theoretical specification for your contest submission.

### **Project Name: The Aero-Elastic Precision Launcher (AEPL)**

### **1. Frame & Fork (The Structure)**

*   **Material:** **CNC-machined Aluminum 7075-T651**
*   **Dimensions:** Overall Height: 280mm; Grip Width: 45mm; Fork Width (outer): 110mm; Fork Tip Diameter: 12mm.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Aluminum 7075:** Chosen for its exceptional **specific strength** (strength-to-density ratio). It's significantly stronger than 6061 (Tensile Strength: ~570 MPa vs. 310 MPa) while remaining lightweight. This minimizes energy lost to accelerating the frame itself during the shot cycle.
    *   **Fork Width:** A 110mm gap optimizes the **force-draw curve**. A narrower fork would make the bands too stiff and "grabby," hurting control. A wider fork would lengthen the power stroke but reduce peak force. 110mm is a proven sweet spot for high energy storage and comfortable aiming.
    *   **Fork Tips:** The 12mm diameter provides a large, smooth radius to minimize **stress concentration** and wear on the band attachment points, a critical failure point. This enhances durability and repeatability.

### **2. Elastic Energy Storage (The Bands)**

*   **Material:** **Layered Latex Tubing** (e.g., 0.5mm thick sheets laminated into a tapered set)
*   **Dimensions:** **Tapered:** 20mm wide at the fork, tapering to 10mm at the pouch. Active Length (per side): 250mm.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Tapered Design:** This is non-negotiable for efficiency. A tapered band ensures that **stress is distributed evenly** along its entire length during draw. A constant-width band would experience highest stress at the fork and snap prematurely. This maximizes energy storage capacity and material usage.
    *   **Latex:** Offers an excellent combination of **high energy return** (low hysteresis) and durability. Its elastic properties are well-understood and predictable for modeling.
    *   **Active Length:** The 250mm length, combined with the draw length, defines the **power stroke**. This length allows for a full, efficient draw without becoming unwieldy or "mushy" in feel.

### **3. Projectile & Pouch**

*   **Projectile Material/Shape:** **Solid Zinc Sphere** (or polished steel bearing for less friction)
*   **Projectile Mass:** **20 grams** (± 0.1 gram tolerance)
*   **Pouch Material:** **Synthetic leather** with a precision-molded cradle.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Spherical Shape:** Minimizes **aerodynamic drag** and provides a consistent, predictable contact point with the pouch and release mechanism. This is paramount for achieving maximum distance and precision.
    *   **Mass (20g):** This mass provides a high **momentum** (`p = m*v`) which is key for defeating air resistance. It also creates an optimal **load** for the elastic bands, allowing them to work efficiently without being under-stressed (which reduces energy transfer) or over-stressed (which causes failure).
    *   **Pouch:** The synthetic leather is durable and provides a consistent, low-friction release surface. The molded cradle ensures the spherical projectile is centered perfectly every time.

### **4. Release & Activation Mechanism**

*   **Mechanism Type:** **Mechanical Sear Release**
*   **Operation:** The pouch is attached to a pivoting "sear" arm. The user draws back, and the arm locks into a latch. Pulling a separate trigger releases the sear, which rotates clear of the projectile.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Decoupling the Human:** This is the single most important feature for **repeatability**. It completely eliminates the variability of a human finger release—the biggest source of error in traditional slingshots.
    *   **Consistent Release Point:** The mechanical release ensures the projectile is launched from the *exact same point* in the draw cycle every time, with the *exact same* orientation. This directly translates to tight grouping and precision.
    *   **Safety:** Contains the energy and provides a controlled firing process, aligning with the contest's requirement for a "safe, controlled environment."

### **Theoretical Performance Optimization (For Your Presentation)**

*   **Energy Efficiency:** The tapered band design and spherical projectile minimize energy losses to heat (hysteresis) and aerodynamic drag, respectively. The lightweight frame ensures more of the user's input energy goes directly into accelerating the projectile.
*   **Repeatability (Precision):** The mechanical sear release is the key. By eliminating the human element from the release phase, the AEPL's shot-to-shot consistency is limited only by the material consistency of the bands and the projectile's aerodynamics—which are both high.
*   **Stress Analysis (To Mention):** "Our theoretical FEA analysis focuses on two areas: 1) Tensile stress in the bands at full draw, ensuring it remains well below the ultimate tensile strength of latex with a safety factor >3. 2) Shear stress on the sear mechanism pin at the moment of release, confirming the chosen material (e.g., hardened steel) can withstand the impulsive load without deformation."

### **Key Trade-off to Acknowledge:**

*   **Complexity vs. "Purity":** The design introduces a mechanical release mechanism to a traditionally simple weapon. The trade-off is added complexity and mass versus a pure, hand-held slingshot. However, this complexity is justified and necessary to win on the contest's metrics of **precision and repeatability**, which would be impossible to achieve with a finger release at high power levels.

This blueprint provides a strong, theoretically-grounded foundation for a winning entry that is elegant, efficient, and precisely engineered for the contest's goals.
