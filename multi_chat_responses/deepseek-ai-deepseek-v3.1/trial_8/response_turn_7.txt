Of course. This is an excellent and critical question that bridges theoretical design and real-world safety considerations.

### **Would this design be unsafe with rock or steel projectiles?**

**Yes, absolutely.** Using rock or standard steel balls instead of the specified tungsten sphere would make the device profoundly unsafe, primarily for two reasons beyond just exceeding the 60J energy cap.

**1. The Energy Would Still Be Lethally High (It Would Far Exceed 60J)**
The 60J safety cap is a critical benchmark. For perspective:
*   A typical police 40mm "less lethal" rubber impact round carries approximately 80-100 Joules.
*   A .22 caliber Long Rifle bullet carries roughly **180-200 Joules** of energy.

Our theoretical "Project Hades" design stores **2,250 Joules**. This is an order of magnitude more energy than a .22 LR round and is firmly in the realm of **high-powered rifle cartridges**. Whether this energy is transferred via a tungsten sphere, a steel ball, or a rock, it represents a lethally dangerous amount of force. The 60J cap would be exceeded by a factor of over **35x**.

**2. The Projectile Material Itself Introduces Catastrophic New Risks**
Even if you could magically reduce the energy to under 60J, the choice of projectile material remains a critical safety factor.

*   **Rock (Extremely Unsafe):**
    *   **Irregular Shape & Poor Aerodynamics:** This would cause wildly unpredictable flight paths (yaw, tumble), making it completely inaccurate and a danger to anything in a wide area downrange.
    *   **Shattering / Fragmentation:** Upon launching, the immense acceleration and stress could cause a rock to shatter either in the pouch or immediately after launch. This would turn the device into a **fragmentation grenade**, sending high-velocity stone shards in all directions, including back towards the operator.
    *   **Inconsistent Mass:** No two rocks are identical. This mass variance would make the device's performance completely unrepeatable and unpredictable.

*   **Steel Ball (Moderately Less Unsafe, but still very dangerous):**
    *   **Predictable Shape:** A spherical steel bearing is aerodynamically predictable, so its flight path would be stable.
    *   **Lighter Mass:** A steel ball of the same *diameter* (50mm) as the tungsten sphere would have significantly less mass (and therefore less energy), but it would still be dangerously high.
        *   Tungsten Density: ~19.3 g/cm³
        *   Steel Density: ~7.8 g/cm³
        *   A 50mm steel sphere would have a mass of ~0.51 kg. Launched at the same theoretical velocity (~95 m/s), its kinetic energy would be `½ * 0.51kg * (95m/s)² = ~2,300 Joules`. **This is still ~38x over the 60J safety cap.**
    *   To get a steel projectile under 60J with this launcher, you would need an impractically tiny steel ball (e.g., ~12mm diameter).

### **Summary: Why the Original Tungsten Design is "Theoretically" Safer**

Within the extreme context of this theoretical exercise, the tungsten sphere is the "safest" option for achieving the design goal because:
*   **Mass Efficiency:** It allows you to use a *smaller diameter* projectile to achieve the desired high mass. A smaller projectile has less aerodynamic drag and a smaller impact profile.
*   **Structural Integrity:** A machined metal sphere is extremely unlikely to fragment under the launch forces, unlike rock.
*   **Predictability:** Its perfectly uniform shape and mass are prerequisites for any repeatable, "precision" calculation.

**Conclusion:** The safety risks described here are precisely why the judges initially asked for a *theoretical* exercise. The forces involved are not just unsafe; they are **militaristic**. Any physical build of this design would be irreponsibly dangerous and would immediately be disqualified from any academic contest with a 60J energy limit. The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate your understanding of the physics and material science at the absolute limit, *precisely so you understand why such limits exist for physical devices.*
