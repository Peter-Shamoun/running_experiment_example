### **Project Ares: Force-Optimized Gravitational Launcher**
**Design Objective:** To maximize projectile launch force through mechanical advantage and efficient energy transfer.

### **1. General Design Overview**

Project Ares is a compound trebuchet system. It utilizes a falling counterweight for high energy input, which is amplified through a pulley system (tackle) to accelerate a massive launch arm. This design maximizes force output by optimizing the three key levers of projectile acceleration: **Impulse Time, Mechanical Advantage, and Mass.**

### **3. Design Rationale**

This design excels by optimizing each subsystem for force generation:
*   **High-Mass Counterweight (25 kg):** Provides the fundamental energy input. The force of gravity (F = M_cw * g) is the engine of the system.
*   **Compound Pulley (4:1 MA):** This is the critical force multiplier. It trades distance for force. The 4:1 advantage means the force applied to the launch arm is **4x** the force generated by the falling counterweight.
*   **Long, Lightweight Lever (3.0 m arm):** The long arm increases the **torque** applied at the pivot point (τ = F * d). The carbon fiber construction ensures minimal energy is wasted moving the arm itself.
*   **High-Mass Projectile (5.0 kg):** Force is demonstrated by accelerating a mass (F = m*a). A larger mass allows the measurement of a larger force for the same acceleration.

### **4. Force & Energy Calculations**

**Assumptions:** Neglect friction & air resistance for theoretical maximums. Gravitational acceleration (g) = 9.81 m/s².

**Step 1: Force Generated by Counterweight (F_cw)**
`F_cw = M_cw * g = 25 kg * 9.81 m/s² = 245.25 N`

**Step 2: Force Amplified by Pulley System (F_pull)**
`F_pull = F_cw * Mechanical Advantage = 245.25 N * 4 = 981 N`
*This is the force applied to the end of the launch arm.*

**Step 3: Torque at Pivot Point (τ)**
`τ = F_pull * L_arm = 981 N * 3.0 m = 2,943 N·m`

**Step 4: Angular Acceleration of Arm (α)**
*First, calculate the Moment of Inertia (I) of the arm (modeled as a rod rotating about its end).*
`I_arm = (1/3) * M_arm * L_arm² = (1/3) * 2.5 kg * (3.0 m)² = 7.5 kg·m²`
*Now calculate angular acceleration.*
`α = τ / I_arm = 2,943 N·m / 7.5 kg·m² = 392.4 rad/s²`

**Step 5: Linear Acceleration of Projectile (a_proj)**
*The tangential acceleration at the end of the arm is equal to the linear acceleration of the projectile.*
`a_proj = α * L_arm = 392.4 rad/s² * 3.0 m = 1,177.2 m/s²`

**Step 6: TOTAL FORCE OUTPUT (F_out)**
`F_out = M_proj * a_proj = 5.0 kg * 1,177.2 m/s² = 5,886 Newtons`
**Final Theoretical Force Output: ~5.9 kN**

### **5. Conclusion**

Project Ares is theoretically capable of generating approximately **5,900 Newtons** of force to accelerate its projectile. This immense output is achieved by synergistically combining the principles of gravitational potential energy, mechanical advantage, and rotational dynamics. The design prioritizes the efficient transfer of energy from the counterweight to the projectile, with material choices minimizing losses, making it the optimal choice for maximizing force in a controlled, academic environment.
