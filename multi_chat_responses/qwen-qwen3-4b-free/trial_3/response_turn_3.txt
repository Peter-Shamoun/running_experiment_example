USER PROMPT:
Perfect specifications! I need a few final details: 1) How should the elastic bands attach to the frame mounting points - what specific attachment method? 2) What material and dimensions for the pouch that connects the bands to the projectile? 3) What fabrication methods should I use to construct the carbon fiber frame? 4) For the human factors - what's the estimated total work input (Joules) the operator must provide to draw the bands to the 150% pre-stretch position?

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Here are the **final technical details** for your Y-frame elastic launcher, optimized for **maximum energy output** and **human-operability**:

---

### **1. Elastic Band Attachment Method**  
**Attachment Type**: **Parallel band system with reinforced mounting points**.  
**Specific Method**:  
- **Mounting Points**: Use **carbon fiber or aluminum brackets** (1.2 cm thick) attached to the frame’s arm ends.  
- **Band Attachment**:  
  - **Epoxy-coated steel pins** (1.5 mm diameter) inserted into the brackets.  
  - **Elastic bands** are looped around the pins and **tensioned via a ratchet mechanism** (e.g., a 3:1 lever system) to control pre-stretch.  
- **Reinforcement**: Add **carbon fiber wraps** (1 mm thick) around the mounting points to prevent stress fractures during launch.

### **2. Pouch Dimensions and Material**  
**Material**: **Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)** or **reinforced nylon** (for durability and weight).  
**Dimensions**:  
- **Length**: 20 cm (to accommodate 4 bands stretched to 2.25 m).  
- **Width**: 10 cm (matches the frame’s width for alignment).  
- **Depth**: 5 cm (to hold the bands and projectile).  
- **Design**:  
  - **Tapered ends** to reduce friction with the frame.  
  - **Internal guide rails** (carbon fiber) to keep the bands aligned during pre-stretch.

### **3. Carbon Fiber Frame Fabrication Methods**  
**Method**: **Hand lay-up with vacuum bagging** (for a balance of cost and quality).  
**Steps**:  
1. **Mold**: Use a **3D-printed mold** for the Y-frame geometry (30 cm arm length, 10 cm width).  
2. **Lay-up**:  
   - **Carbon fiber plies** (12 oz per layer) are hand-laid over the mold.  
   - **Epoxy resin** (200-250 g/m²) is applied to impregnate the plies.  
3. **Vacuum Bagging**:  
   - Seal the mold with a **vacuum bag** and apply **compressed air** to remove air bubbles.  
   - Cure at **120°C for 24 hours**.  
4. **Post-Processing**:  
   - Sand the frame to match the desired dimensions.  
   - Apply **epoxy coatings** for a smooth finish.

### **4. Human Factors: Total Work Input (Joules)**  
**Calculation**:  
- **Pre-stretch**: 150% of the band’s original length (1.5 m → 2.25 m).  
- **Force Required**:  
  $$
  F = k \times x = 100 \, \text{N/m} \times 0.75 \, \text{m} = 75 \, \text{N}
  $$  
- **Work Input (Energy)**:  
  $$
  W = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times (0.75)^2 = 28.125 \, \text{J/band} \times 4 = 112.5 \, \text{J}
  $$  
- **Human Effort**: The operator must **input 112.5 J** of work to stretch the bands to 150% pre-stretch. This corresponds to **~8 N of force** applied over **0.75 m** (work = force × distance).

### **Summary of Key Values**  
| Parameter               | Value                          | Notes                          |  
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Frame Material         | Carbon Fiber (0.8 kg)         | 20% lighter than aluminum     |  
| Elastic Energy         | 112.5 J (4 bands)             | Natural rubber for max stretch|  
| Projectile KE          | 45 J (80% efficiency)         | 100g mass, 30 m/s velocity    |  
| Human Work Input       | **112.5 J** (operator)        | Ideal system, 100% efficiency |  
| Frame Fabrication      | Hand lay-up + vacuum bagging  | Feasible for competition use  |

**Final Note**: This design assumes **ideal energy transfer** (no friction or mechanical losses). In practice, adjust for 80–90% efficiency by increasing the pre-stretch or using heavier bands. Let me know if you need a **3D model** or **CAD blueprint**!
