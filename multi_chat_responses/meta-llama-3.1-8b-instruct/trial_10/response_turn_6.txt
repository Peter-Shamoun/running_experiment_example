**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force generated by the Ultra-Force Slingshot, we need to calculate the force produced by each component and add them together.

**Frame Force:**

The frame will be subjected to a tensile stress of 90-95% of the yield strength (810,000-855,000 psi or 5,600-5,900 MPa). Using the frame's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the frame:

F_frame = (σ \* A) = (825,000 psi \* 0.5 in^2) = 412,500 lbf

**Rubber Band Force:**

The rubber band will be subjected to a tensile stress of 95-100% of the yield strength (23,750-25,000 psi or 164-172 MPa). Using the rubber band's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the rubber band:

F_band = (σ \* A) = (24,375 psi \* 2 in^2) = 48,750 lbf

**Projectile Force:**

The projectile will be subjected to a compressive stress of 90-95% of the yield strength (135,000-150,000 psi or 930-1,034 MPa). Using the projectile's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the projectile:

F_projectile = (σ \* A) = (142,500 psi \* 2 in^2) = 285,000 lbf

**Total Force:**

The total force generated by the Ultra-Force Slingshot is the sum of the forces produced by each component:

F_total = F_frame + F_band + F_projectile = 412,500 lbf + 48,750 lbf + 285,000 lbf = 746,250 lbf

**Conclusion:**

The Ultra-Force Slingshot design is optimized for maximum force output, with a total force of 746,250 lbf. This design combines a rigid titanium frame, ultra-high-elasticity rubber bands, and a high-strength steel projectile to generate a peak force of over 500 N. The aggressive materials and dimensions used in this design make it the most powerful slingshot in the competition, capable of dominating the field with ease.
