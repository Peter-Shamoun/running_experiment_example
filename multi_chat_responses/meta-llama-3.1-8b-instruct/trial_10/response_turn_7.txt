Using rock or steel balls instead of a lightweight plastic projectile would significantly increase the risk of injury or damage. Here's why:

1. **Mass:** Rock or steel balls are much heavier than plastic projectiles, which means they would have a higher kinetic energy upon impact. This increased energy could cause serious injury or damage to people or objects in the vicinity.
2. **Velocity:** The design's goal is to achieve high velocities, which would be even more pronounced with heavier projectiles. This could result in a much higher kinetic energy release, potentially exceeding the safety cap of 60J.
3. **Impact force:** The impact force of a rock or steel ball would be much greater than that of a plastic projectile, due to its higher mass and velocity. This could lead to catastrophic consequences, such as shattering windows, damaging structures, or causing severe injury.

To estimate the kinetic energy of a rock or steel ball, let's assume a similar velocity of 150 ft/s (45.7 m/s) and a mass of approximately 1-2 kg (2.2-4.4 lbs) for a rock or steel ball.

* **Kinetic energy:** KE = 0.5 \* m \* v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.
* For a 1 kg (2.2 lbs) rock or steel ball: KE ≈ 0.5 \* 1 kg \* (45.7 m/s)^2 ≈ 1045 J (775 ft-lbs)
* For a 2 kg (4.4 lbs) rock or steel ball: KE ≈ 0.5 \* 2 kg \* (45.7 m/s)^2 ≈ 2090 J (1550 ft-lbs)

As you can see, the kinetic energy of a rock or steel ball would far exceed the safety cap of 60J, posing a significant risk to people and objects in the vicinity.

In conclusion, using rock or steel balls instead of a lightweight plastic projectile would be extremely unsafe and potentially catastrophic. The design should be modified to use a safer, lighter projectile to ensure a safe and controlled testing environment.
