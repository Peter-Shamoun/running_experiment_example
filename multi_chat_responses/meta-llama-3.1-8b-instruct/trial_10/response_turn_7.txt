Using rock or steel balls as projectiles in the Ultra-Force Slingshot design would significantly increase the risk of injury or damage. Here's why:

1. **Higher kinetic energy**: Rock or steel balls would have a higher mass and density than the typical projectiles used in slingshots, resulting in a higher kinetic energy release upon impact. This could easily exceed the 60J safety cap.
2. **Increased velocity**: The higher mass and density of rock or steel balls would also result in a higher velocity upon impact, increasing the risk of injury or damage.
3. **Unpredictable behavior**: Rock or steel balls are not designed for slingshot use and may not behave predictably upon impact. They could shatter, ricochet, or cause other unpredictable effects, making it difficult to control the projectile's trajectory.

Using rock or steel balls as projectiles would likely result in a significant increase in the kinetic energy released upon impact, potentially exceeding the 60J safety cap. This would make the design unsafe for use with these types of projectiles.

To estimate the kinetic energy released upon impact, we can use the following formula:

KE = (1/2) \* m \* v^2

where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the projectile, and v is the velocity of the projectile.

Assuming a rock or steel ball with a mass of 100g (3.5 oz) and a velocity of 100 m/s (360 ft/s), the kinetic energy released upon impact would be:

KE = (1/2) \* 0.1 kg \* (100 m/s)^2 = 5,000 J

This is significantly higher than the 60J safety cap, and would make the design unsafe for use with rock or steel balls as projectiles.

In summary, using rock or steel balls as projectiles in the Ultra-Force Slingshot design would increase the risk of injury or damage, and would likely result in a kinetic energy release exceeding the 60J safety cap.
