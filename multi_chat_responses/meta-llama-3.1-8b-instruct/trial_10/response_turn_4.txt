Here's a detailed blueprint for the simple slingshot design, with specifications for each component and engineering rationales:

**Frame:**

* **Height**: 36-40 inches (91-102 cm)
* **Width**: 18-22 inches (46-56 cm)
* **Depth**: 12-16 inches (30-40 cm)
* **Material**: Aluminum alloy 6063 (T6 or T4)
* **Key properties**:
	+ Tensile strength: 30,000 psi (207 MPa)
	+ Yield strength: 25,000 psi (172 MPa)
	+ Modulus of elasticity: 8.5 x 10^6 psi (58 GPa)
	+ Density: 2.5 g/cm^3
* **Engineering rationale**: The frame will be designed to withstand torsional stresses of 20-25% of the yield strength (5,000-6,250 psi or 35-43 MPa), bending stresses of 15-20% of the yield strength (3,750-5,000 psi or 26-35 MPa), and axial stresses of 10-15% of the yield strength (2,500-3,750 psi or 17-26 MPa).

**Elastic:**

* **Material**: High-elasticity rubber (e.g., 70A or 90A)
* **Properties**:
	+ Elastic modulus: 10-15 x 10^6 psi (69-103 GPa)
	+ Tensile strength: 10,000-15,000 psi (69-103 MPa)
	+ Yield strength: 8,000-12,000 psi (55-83 MPa)
* **Engineering rationale**: The elastic will be designed to store elastic potential energy when stretched, and release it when the user pulls the trigger or releases the projectile. The elastic modulus will be chosen to provide a high elastic potential energy storage capacity.

**Projectile:**

* **Material**: Steel or a high-strength, high-elasticity material (e.g., 7075-T6 aluminum)
* **Properties**:
	+ Density: 2.5-3.5 g/cm^3
	+ **Engineering rationale**: The projectile will be designed to withstand the stresses imposed by the elastic and the frame, and will be optimized for a high kinetic energy storage capacity.

**Band:**

* **Material**: High-elasticity rubber (e.g., 70A or 90A)
* **Properties**:
	+ Elastic modulus: 10-15 x 10^6 psi (69-103 GPa)
	+ Tensile strength: 10,000-15,000 psi (69-103 MPa)
	+ Yield strength: 8,000-12,000 psi (55-83 MPa)
* **Engineering rationale**: The band will be designed to store elastic potential energy when stretched, and release it when the user pulls the trigger or releases the projectile.

**Measurement and Control:**

* **Sensors**: Linear potentiometers or linear variable displacement sensors will be used to measure the elastic potential energy stored in the elastic and band.
* **Control system**: A simple control system will be used to control the elastic potential energy storage and release, using the sensor data to adjust the elastic and band properties.

**Engineering Rationale:**

The simple slingshot design will be optimized for raw distance and precision performance. The frame will be designed to withstand the stresses imposed by the elastic and the projectile, and will be optimized for a high elastic potential energy storage capacity. The elastic and band will be designed to store and release elastic potential energy efficiently, and will be optimized for a high kinetic energy storage capacity. The control system will be used to adjust the elastic and band properties in real-time, based on sensor data.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the key components**: Emphasize the frame, elastic, projectile, and band as the key components of the simple slingshot design.
2. **Discuss the engineering rationales**: Explain the engineering rationales behind each component, highlighting the stress loads, energy storage, and precision considerations.
3. **Showcase the optimization**: Highlight how the design is optimized for raw distance and precision performance, and how the control system adjusts the elastic and band properties in real-time.
