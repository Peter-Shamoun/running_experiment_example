For a simple slingshot design, the main structural frame would differ significantly from the Aerius design. Here's a high-level overview of the design considerations:

**Simple Slingshot Design:**

1. **Frame shape**: A simple slingshot frame would be a more compact, U-shaped or Y-shaped structure, with a shorter height and width compared to the Aerius design.
2. **Material**: A lighter, more flexible material such as wood, plastic, or a thin metal alloy (e.g., aluminum 6063) would be suitable for a simple slingshot frame.
3. **Key components**:
	* **Rams**: The frame would have two rams or arms that store elastic potential energy when stretched.
	* **Pivots**: The rams would pivot around a central axis, allowing the user to load and release the projectile.
	* **Projectile holder**: A simple holder or pouch would be attached to the frame to secure the projectile.
4. **Design considerations**:
	* **Elastic potential energy**: The frame would be designed to store elastic potential energy in the rams, which would be released when the user pulls the trigger or releases the projectile.
	* **Kinetic energy**: The frame would need to be designed to efficiently transfer the stored elastic potential energy into kinetic energy of the projectile.
	* **Safety**: The design would need to ensure safe operation, with a secure projectile holder and a mechanism to prevent accidental releases.

**Key differences from the Aerius design:**

1. **Simpler mechanism**: The simple slingshot design relies on a more straightforward mechanism, with fewer components and less complexity compared to the Aerius design.
2. **Less emphasis on precision**: The simple slingshot design is more focused on raw power and distance, rather than precision and accuracy.
3. **More emphasis on user interaction**: The simple slingshot design requires more user interaction, with the user needing to load, aim, and release the projectile manually.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity**: Emphasize the simplicity of the design and how it achieves its goals with fewer components and less complexity.
2. **Discuss the tradeoffs**: Explain the tradeoffs between the simple slingshot design and the Aerius design, highlighting the differences in precision, power, and user interaction.
3. **Showcase the design's strengths**: Highlight the strengths of the simple slingshot design, such as its ease of use, portability, and affordability.
