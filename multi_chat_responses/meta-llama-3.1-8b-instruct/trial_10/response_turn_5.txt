**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force generated by the High-Force Slingshot, we need to calculate the force produced by each component and add them together.

**Frame Force:**

The frame will be subjected to a tensile stress of 20-25% of the yield strength (5,000-6,250 psi or 35-43 MPa). Using the frame's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the frame:

F_frame = (σ \* A) = (5,000 psi \* 0.25 in^2) = 1,250 lbf

**Rubber Band Force:**

The rubber band will be subjected to a tensile stress of 15-20% of the yield strength (2,250-3,000 psi or 15-20 MPa). Using the rubber band's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the rubber band:

F_band = (σ \* A) = (2,500 psi \* 0.25 in^2) = 625 lbf

**Projectile Force:**

The projectile will be subjected to a compressive stress of 10-15% of the yield strength (9,000-13,500 psi or 62-93 MPa). Using the projectile's dimensions and material properties, we can calculate the force produced by the projectile:

F_projectile = (σ \* A) = (10,500 psi \* 0.25 in^2) = 2,625 lbf

**Total Force:**

The total force generated by the High-Force Slingshot is the sum of the forces produced by each component:

F_total = F_frame + F_band + F_projectile = 1,250 lbf + 625 lbf + 2,625 lbf = 4,500 lbf

**Conclusion:**

The High-Force Slingshot design is optimized for maximum force output, with a total force of 4,500 lbf. This design combines a rigid frame, a high-elasticity rubber band, and a steel projectile to generate a high force output. The calculations demonstrate that the frame, rubber band, and projectile all contribute to the total force output, making this design an excellent choice for the competition.
