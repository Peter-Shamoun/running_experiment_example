**Scaling the Main Structural Frame:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an average adult user (around 5'10" height), I recommend scaling the main structural frame as follows:

1. **Height**: 48-52 inches (122-132 cm) to accommodate a comfortable standing position and allow for easy access to the flywheel and crank.
2. **Width**: 24-28 inches (61-71 cm) to provide a stable base and allow for easy maneuverability.
3. **Depth**: 18-22 inches (46-56 cm) to accommodate the flywheel, crank, and pneumatic launch system.

These dimensions will provide a comfortable working space for the user and allow for easy access to the various components.

**Suitable Material:**

For the main structural frame, I recommend using aluminum alloy 6061-T6. This material offers an excellent balance of strength, stiffness, and weight.

**Key Properties:**

* Tensile strength: 42,000 psi (290 MPa)
* Yield strength: 35,000 psi (241 MPa)
* Modulus of elasticity: 10.2 x 10^6 psi (70 GPa)
* Density: 2.7 g/cm^3

**Engineering Rationale:**

The main structural frame will be subjected to various loads during operation, including:

1. **Torsional loads**: From the flywheel and crank, which will be transmitted to the frame through the crankshaft and bearings.
2. **Bending loads**: From the user's weight and any external loads (e.g., wind, vibrations).
3. **Axial loads**: From the pneumatic launch system and any external loads.

To ensure the frame can withstand these loads, we'll apply basic stress considerations:

1. **Torsional stress**: The frame will be designed to withstand a maximum torsional stress of 20-25% of the yield strength (7,000-8,750 psi or 48-60 MPa).
2. **Bending stress**: The frame will be designed to withstand a maximum bending stress of 15-20% of the yield strength (5,250-7,000 psi or 36-48 MPa).
3. **Axial stress**: The frame will be designed to withstand a maximum axial stress of 10-15% of the yield strength (3,500-5,250 psi or 24-36 MPa).

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

Assuming a maximum user weight of 150 lbs (68 kg) and a maximum external load of 20 lbs (9 kg), we can estimate the maximum stresses as follows:

1. **Torsional stress**: 20-25% of yield strength = 7,000-8,750 psi (48-60 MPa)
2. **Bending stress**: 15-20% of yield strength = 5,250-7,000 psi (36-48 MPa)
3. **Axial stress**: 10-15% of yield strength = 3,500-5,250 psi (24-36 MPa)

These calculations provide a basic estimate of the stresses the frame will be subjected to. In a real-world design, more detailed stress analysis and finite element modeling would be necessary to ensure the frame's integrity.
