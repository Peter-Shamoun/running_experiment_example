Let's scale the dimensions of the Aerius launcher to fit an average adult user.

**Structural Frame Dimensions:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency and comfort for the user, we'll aim to position the crank handle at a height that allows the user to operate it with a slight bend in the elbow and a neutral wrist position. This will help distribute the force and reduce fatigue.

Assuming a 5'10" (178 cm) user height, let's set the crank handle height at approximately 34-36 inches (86-91 cm) above the floor. This will allow the user to operate the crank with a slight bend in the elbow and a neutral wrist position.

For the overall frame dimensions, we can use the following rough estimates:

* **Height:** 48-52 inches (122-132 cm)
* **Width:** 24-28 inches (61-71 cm)
* **Depth:** 18-22 inches (46-56 cm)

**Material Selection:**

For the structural frame, we'll choose a material that balances strength, stiffness, and weight. A suitable material for this application is **6061-T6 Aluminum**.

**Key Properties:**

* **Tensile Strength:** 42,000 psi (290 MPa)
* **Yield Strength:** 35,000 psi (241 MPa)
* **Density:** 0.098 lb/in³ (2.7 g/cm³)
* **Young's Modulus:** 10,000,000 psi (69,000 MPa)

**Engineering Rationale and Stress Considerations:**

The structural frame will be subjected to various loads during operation, including:

1. **Crank force:** The user will apply a force to the crank handle, which will be transmitted to the flywheel and then to the launch system.
2. **Weight of the launcher:** The frame will support the weight of the launcher, including the flywheel, launch system, and guidance system.
3. **Launch acceleration:** During launch, the frame will experience a rapid acceleration, which will generate inertial forces.

To ensure the structural frame can withstand these loads, we'll consider the following stress considerations:

1. **Bending stress:** The frame will experience bending stresses due to the crank force and launch acceleration. We'll design the frame to withstand a maximum bending stress of 20,000 psi (138 MPa).
2. **Torsional stress:** The crank handle will apply a torsional force to the frame, which will be transmitted to the flywheel. We'll design the frame to withstand a maximum torsional stress of 15,000 psi (103 MPa).
3. **Compressive stress:** The frame will experience compressive stresses due to the weight of the launcher. We'll design the frame to withstand a maximum compressive stress of 30,000 psi (207 MPa).

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

To estimate the stresses in the frame, we'll use the following formulas:

* **Bending stress:** σ = (M \* y) / I, where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia.
* **Torsional stress:** τ = (T \* r) / J, where T is the torsional moment, r is the radius of the crank handle, and J is the polar moment of inertia.
* **Compressive stress:** σ = F / A, where F is the compressive force and A is the cross-sectional area.

These calculations will provide a rough estimate of the stresses in the frame and help us determine the required material thickness and cross-sectional area.

Please note that these are simplified calculations and actual stress analysis should be performed using more advanced methods, such as finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

For the purposes of this contest entry, these calculations will provide a good starting point for our analysis and presentation.
