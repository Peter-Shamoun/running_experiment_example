Using rock or steel balls instead of a lightweight projectile like the one described in the Apex-X design would significantly increase the potential for injury or damage. Here's why:

1. **Mass and velocity:** Rock or steel balls are much heavier than the titanium alloy projectile, which means they would have a higher mass and velocity when launched. This would increase the kinetic energy of the projectile, potentially exceeding the safety cap of 60J.
2. **Impact force:** The impact force of a rock or steel ball would be much higher than that of a lightweight projectile. This is because the force of impact is proportional to the mass and velocity of the object, as well as the coefficient of restitution (COR) between the projectile and the target. A rock or steel ball would likely have a higher COR than a lightweight projectile, resulting in a more severe impact.
3. **Penetration depth:** A rock or steel ball could potentially penetrate deeper into the target, causing more damage or injury.

To estimate the potential energy of a rock or steel ball, let's consider a few examples:

* A 1-inch (2.5 cm) steel ball with a mass of 100 grams and a velocity of 500 m/s would have a kinetic energy of approximately 250 J.
* A 1-inch (2.5 cm) rock with a mass of 200 grams and a velocity of 500 m/s would have a kinetic energy of approximately 500 J.
* A 2-inch (5 cm) steel ball with a mass of 400 grams and a velocity of 500 m/s would have a kinetic energy of approximately 1000 J.

As you can see, the potential energy of a rock or steel ball is significantly higher than the safety cap of 60J. This is why using such projectiles would be unsafe and potentially hazardous.

In the context of the competition, using rock or steel balls would likely result in a disqualification or a penalty, as it would compromise the safety of the participants and the surrounding environment.
