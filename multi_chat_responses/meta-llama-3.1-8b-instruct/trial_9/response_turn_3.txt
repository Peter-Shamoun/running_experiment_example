For a simple slingshot design, the structural requirements and material selection would differ significantly from the Aerius launcher. Here's a high-level overview of the design considerations for a simple slingshot:

**Key Design Considerations:**

1. **Structural simplicity**: A slingshot typically consists of a few simple components, such as a frame, a pouch, and a launching arm.
2. **Low weight**: A slingshot is designed to be lightweight and portable, making it easier to carry and use.
3. **High tensile strength**: The launching arm and pouch must withstand high tensile stresses during the launching process.
4. **Low cost**: A slingshot is typically a low-cost, DIY project, so materials and manufacturing processes should be cost-effective.

**Material Selection:**

For a simple slingshot, I recommend using **Bamboo** or **Wood** as the primary structural material. These materials offer:

* **High tensile strength**: Bamboo and wood can withstand high tensile stresses, making them suitable for the launching arm and pouch.
* **Low weight**: Bamboo and wood are relatively lightweight, making them easy to carry and use.
* **Low cost**: Bamboo and wood are often readily available and inexpensive, making them a cost-effective choice.
* **Aesthetics**: Bamboo and wood can add a natural, rustic touch to the design.

**Design Variations:**

There are several design variations for simple slingshots, including:

1. **Classic slingshot**: A traditional design with a Y-shaped frame, a pouch, and a launching arm.
2. **Over-under slingshot**: A design with an over-under configuration, where the launching arm is positioned above or below the pouch.
3. **Pistol-grip slingshot**: A design with a pistol-grip handle, providing a more comfortable and secure grip.

**Key Stress Considerations:**

For a simple slingshot, the primary stress considerations are:

1. **Tensile stresses**: The launching arm and pouch must withstand high tensile stresses during the launching process.
2. **Compressive stresses**: The frame and pouch must withstand compressive stresses due to the user's grip and the launching force.

To mitigate these stresses, designers can use various techniques, such as:

1. **Thickening**: Increasing the thickness of the launching arm and pouch to reduce stress concentrations.
2. **Reinforcement**: Adding reinforcement, such as ribs or gussets, to increase the structural integrity of the slingshot.
3. **Material selection**: Selecting materials with higher strength-to-weight ratios, such as carbon fiber or Kevlar-reinforced composites.

These design considerations and material selections would result in a simple, lightweight, and cost-effective slingshot design that is suitable for a DIY project or a low-cost, high-performance application.
