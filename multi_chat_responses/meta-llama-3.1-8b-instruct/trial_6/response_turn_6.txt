	+ Height: 0.75 inches (1.9 cm)

**Rationale:**

The Aerius-X3 design is optimized for maximum force output by:

1. **Increasing the rubber band's elastic modulus**: A higher elastic modulus allows for a greater energy storage capacity, resulting in a higher force output.
2. **Increasing the rubber band's stretch ratio**: A higher stretch ratio enables the rubber band to store more energy, leading to a higher force output.
3. **Extending the draw length**: A longer draw length allows for a greater energy storage capacity, resulting in a higher force output.
4. **Minimizing losses and masses**: Aggressive materials and design choices minimize energy losses and reduce the overall mass of the device.

**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force generated by the Aerius-X3, we'll use the following equations:

1. **Rubber Band Force**: F_rb = (E \* A \* ΔL) / L, where E is the elastic modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, ΔL is the stretch, and L is the original length.
2. **Projectile Acceleration**: a = F_rb / m, where m is the projectile's mass.
3. **Projectile Velocity**: v = √(2 \* a \* d), where d is the distance traveled.

**Results:**

Using the specified measurements and materials, we calculate the following:

1. **Rubber Band Force**: F_rb = (10 MPa \* 0.5 in^2 \* 16 in) / 24 in = 5,333 N (1,200 lbf)
2. **Projectile Acceleration**: a = 5,333 N / 0.02 kg = 266,650 m/s^2 (27,200 g)
3. **Projectile Velocity**: v = √(2 \* 266,650 m/s^2 \* 0.5 m) = 1,032.8 m/s (2,310 mph)

**Total Force Output:**

The total force output of the Aerius-X3 is the sum of the rubber band force and the projectile's kinetic force:

F_total = F_rb + m \* v = 5,333 N + 0.02 kg \* 1,032.8 m/s = 5,333 N + 20.66 N = 5,353.66 N (1,204.5 lbf)

**Why it Obliterates the Field:**

The Aerius-X3 design produces a total force output of 5,353.66 N (1,204.5 lbf), making it the most aggressive and force-efficient slingshot design in the field. Its ultra-high-performance rubber band, extended draw length, and minimized losses and masses enable it to achieve unparalleled performance. This design is the pinnacle of slingshot technology, pushing the limits of materials and physics to achieve maximum force and distance dominance.
