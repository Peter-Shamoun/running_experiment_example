Using rock or steel balls as projectiles in the Aerius-X3 design would significantly increase the risk of injury or damage. Here's why:

1. **Mass and velocity**: Rock or steel balls are much heavier and denser than the ceramic projectile specified in the design. This means they would reach much higher velocities and possess more kinetic energy.
2. **Impact force**: The impact force of a rock or steel ball would be much higher than that of a ceramic projectile, potentially causing severe injury or damage to people or objects in the vicinity.
3. **Safety cap**: The safety cap of 60J is a guideline for the maximum amount of energy that can be safely contained within a projectile. Using rock or steel balls would likely exceed this cap, making the design unsafe.

To estimate the potential energy of a rock or steel ball, let's consider the following:

* **Rock ball**: Assuming a 1-inch (2.5 cm) diameter rock ball with a density of approximately 2.5 g/cm³ (similar to granite), its mass would be around 0.065 kg (0.143 lbs). If it were accelerated to the same velocity as the ceramic projectile (1,032.8 m/s or 2,310 mph), its kinetic energy would be approximately 1,071 J (794 ft-lbf).
* **Steel ball**: Assuming a 1-inch (2.5 cm) diameter steel ball with a density of approximately 7.9 g/cm³ (similar to steel), its mass would be around 0.065 kg (0.143 lbs). If it were accelerated to the same velocity as the ceramic projectile (1,032.8 m/s or 2,310 mph), its kinetic energy would be approximately 3,434 J (2,523 ft-lbf).

Both of these estimates exceed the safety cap of 60J, making the design unsafe for use with rock or steel balls.

In conclusion, while the Aerius-X3 design is optimized for maximum force and distance, it is not suitable for use with rock or steel balls due to the increased risk of injury or damage.
