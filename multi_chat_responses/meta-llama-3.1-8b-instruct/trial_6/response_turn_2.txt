**Scaling the Dimensions:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an average adult user, let's consider the following guidelines:

1. **Crank Handle Height**: Position the crank handle at a height that allows the user to operate it comfortably with their hands at or below shoulder height. A good starting point is to place the crank handle at a height of approximately 30-35 inches (76-89 cm) above the ground.
2. **Flywheel Radius**: The flywheel radius should be large enough to store a significant amount of energy, but not so large that it becomes unwieldy. A radius of around 12-15 inches (30-38 cm) should provide a good balance between energy storage and user comfort.
3. **Pneumatic System Length**: The pneumatic system should be long enough to provide a smooth acceleration profile, but not so long that it becomes difficult to handle. A length of around 24-30 inches (61-76 cm) should be sufficient.
4. **Overall Length**: The overall length of the launcher should be around 48-60 inches (122-152 cm) to accommodate the crank handle, flywheel, and pneumatic system.

**Material Selection:**

For the main structural frame, I recommend using **6061-T6 Aluminum**. This alloy offers an excellent balance of strength, corrosion resistance, and machinability.

**Key Properties:**

* Tensile strength: 45,000 psi (310 MPa)
* Yield strength: 38,000 psi (260 MPa)
* Elongation at break: 12%
* Density: 2.7 g/cm³
* Machinability: Good

**Engineering Rationale and Stress Considerations:**

The main structural frame will be subjected to various loads during operation, including:

1. **Torsional loads**: The crank handle will apply a torsional load to the flywheel, which must be resisted by the frame.
2. **Bending loads**: The pneumatic system will apply a bending load to the frame, particularly at the joints.
3. **Axial loads**: The projectile will apply an axial load to the frame during launch.

To ensure the frame can withstand these loads, we'll consider the following stress considerations:

1. **Torsional stress**: The frame should be designed to resist a torsional stress of around 10-15% of the material's yield strength (3,800-4,200 psi or 260-290 MPa).
2. **Bending stress**: The frame should be designed to resist a bending stress of around 5-10% of the material's yield strength (1,900-3,800 psi or 130-260 MPa).
3. **Axial stress**: The frame should be designed to resist an axial stress of around 10-15% of the material's yield strength (3,800-4,200 psi or 260-290 MPa).

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

To estimate the required frame dimensions, we can use the following simplified calculations:

1. **Torsional stress**: σt = (T \* r) / J, where T is the torsional load, r is the radius of the flywheel, and J is the polar moment of inertia.
2. **Bending stress**: σb = (M \* y) / I, where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme fiber, and I is the moment of inertia.
3. **Axial stress**: σa = (P \* A) / (π \* r^2), where P is the axial load, A is the cross-sectional area, and r is the radius of the projectile.

These calculations will provide a rough estimate of the required frame dimensions and help ensure the structure can withstand the simulated loads. However, please note that a more detailed analysis, including finite element modeling and stress analysis, would be necessary for a production-ready design.
