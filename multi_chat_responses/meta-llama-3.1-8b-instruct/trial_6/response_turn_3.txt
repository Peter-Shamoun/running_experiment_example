For a simple slingshot design, the key differences would be:

**Key Design Considerations:**

1. **Energy Storage**: Instead of a flywheel, a slingshot stores energy in a stretched rubber band or elastic material.
2. **Energy Release**: The energy is released through a sudden release of the rubber band, propelling the projectile.
3. **Projectile Acceleration**: The projectile is accelerated through a relatively short distance, typically a few inches, before leaving the slingshot.

**Design Differences:**

1. **Frame Material**: A slingshot frame can be made from a lighter material, such as wood, plastic, or even a 3D-printed material, as the stresses are lower compared to a flywheel-based design.
2. **Rubber Band Design**: The rubber band would be designed to store a specific amount of energy, taking into account factors like material properties, band thickness, and stretch ratio.
3. **Pivoting Mechanism**: A slingshot typically features a pivoting mechanism, allowing the user to adjust the angle of the rubber band and optimize the launch trajectory.
4. **Projectile Size and Shape**: The projectile would be designed to fit within the slingshot's pouch or channel, with a focus on aerodynamics and stability during flight.

**Key Tradeoffs:**

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Slingshots are generally less energy-efficient than flywheel-based designs, as some energy is lost in the rubber band's stretch and release.
2. **Precision**: Slingshots can be less precise than flywheel-based designs, as the energy release is more difficult to control.
3. **Scalability**: Slingshots are often more difficult to scale up or down, as the rubber band's properties and the frame's design must be carefully optimized for each size.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity**: Emphasize the simplicity and elegance of the slingshot design, which can be an advantage in terms of cost, weight, and complexity.
2. **Discuss the tradeoffs**: Explain the tradeoffs between energy efficiency, precision, and scalability, and how they impact the design.
3. **Showcase the design process**: Walk the audience through the design decisions, material selection, and optimization process for the slingshot.

By understanding the differences between a flywheel-based design and a simple slingshot, you can create a compelling presentation that showcases the unique strengths and tradeoffs of each system.
