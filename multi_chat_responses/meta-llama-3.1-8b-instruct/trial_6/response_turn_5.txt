**Device Name:** Aerius-X2

**Design Overview:**

The Aerius-X2 is a high-performance slingshot designed to maximize force output. The device consists of a rigid frame, a high-strength rubber band, and a precision-crafted projectile.

**Materials:**

* Frame: 7075-T6 Aluminum (high-strength-to-weight ratio)
* Rubber Band: High-performance rubber (e.g., Goodyear's "PowerGrip" or similar)
* Projectile: Lightweight, high-strength plastic (e.g., polycarbonate or ABS)

**Measurements:**

* Frame Dimensions:
	+ Length: 14 inches (35.6 cm)
	+ Width: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
	+ Height: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
* Rubber Band Properties:
	+ Thickness: 0.25 inches (6.4 mm)
	+ Width: 1.5 inches (38.1 mm)
	+ Length: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Elastic Modulus: 3.5 MPa (507 psi)
	+ Maximum Stretch Ratio: 4:1 (400% elongation)
* Projectile Specifications:
	+ Mass: 15 grams (0.53 oz)
	+ Shape: Aerodynamic, teardrop-shaped projectile with a rounded nose and a flat base
	+ Length: 2.5 inches (6.4 cm)
	+ Width: 1 inch (2.5 cm)
	+ Height: 0.5 inches (1.3 cm)

**Rationale:**

The Aerius-X2 design is optimized for maximum force output by:

1. **Increasing the rubber band's elastic modulus**: A higher elastic modulus allows for a greater energy storage capacity, resulting in a higher force output.
2. **Increasing the rubber band's stretch ratio**: A higher stretch ratio enables the rubber band to store more energy, leading to a higher force output.
3. **Using a high-strength frame material**: The 7075-T6 aluminum frame provides a high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a more efficient transfer of energy to the projectile.
4. **Optimizing the projectile's shape and size**: The aerodynamic shape and lightweight material of the projectile minimize air resistance and maximize the force output.

**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force generated by the Aerius-X2, we'll use the following equations:

1. **Rubber Band Force**: F_rb = (E \* A \* ΔL) / L, where E is the elastic modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, ΔL is the stretch, and L is the original length.
2. **Projectile Acceleration**: a = F_rb / m, where m is the projectile's mass.
3. **Projectile Velocity**: v = √(2 \* a \* d), where d is the distance traveled.

**Results:**

Using the specified measurements and materials, we calculate the following:

1. **Rubber Band Force**: F_rb = (3.5 MPa \* 0.25 in^2 \* 4 in) / 12 in = 1,458 N (327 lbf)
2. **Projectile Acceleration**: a = 1,458 N / 0.015 kg = 97,200 m/s^2 (10,200 g)
3. **Projectile Velocity**: v = √(2 \* 97,200 m/s^2 \* 0.5 m) = 140.6 m/s (317 mph)

**Total Force Output:**

The total force output of the Aerius-X2 is the sum of the rubber band force and the projectile's kinetic force:

F_total = F_rb + m \* v = 1,458 N + 0.015 kg \* 140.6 m/s = 1,458 N + 2.11 N = 1,460.11 N (327.5 lbf)

The Aerius-X2 design produces a total force output of 1,460.11 N (327.5 lbf), making it a highly optimized and force-efficient slingshot design.
