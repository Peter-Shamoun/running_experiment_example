For a simple slingshot design, the main structural frame would differ significantly from the Aerius design. Here's a high-level overview of the key differences:

**Simple Slingshot Design:**

1. **Main Structural Frame:** A more compact, lightweight frame would be used, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
2. **Material:** A lighter material such as **6063-T5 Aluminum** or **Carbon Fiber** might be used to minimize weight and maximize portability.
3. **Dimensions:** The frame would be smaller, with a typical height of 12-18 inches (30-45 cm), width of 6-8 inches (15-20 cm), and depth of 4-6 inches (10-15 cm).
4. **Key Components:**
	* **Pivoting Yoke:** A simple pivoting yoke would connect the two main arms of the slingshot, allowing for easy loading and firing.
	* **Arm Length:** The arm length would be shorter, typically around 4-6 inches (10-15 cm), to provide a more compact design.
	* **Ratchet Mechanism:** A simple ratchet mechanism would be used to store energy in the slingshot, allowing the user to load the projectile with a consistent force.
5. **Stress Considerations:**
	* **Tensile Stress:** The main frame would be subjected to tensile stresses due to the user's weight and the weight of the projectile.
	* **Compressive Stress:** The frame would also experience compressive stresses due to the user's weight and any external loads.
	* **Shear Stress:** The pivoting yoke and arm would experience shear stresses due to the rotational motion of the slingshot.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Simplification:** The design would focus on simplicity and ease of use, with a minimal number of components and a straightforward loading mechanism.
2. **Weight Reduction:** The use of lighter materials and a more compact design would minimize the weight of the slingshot, making it easier to carry and use.
3. **Energy Storage:** The ratchet mechanism would store energy in the slingshot, allowing the user to load the projectile with a consistent force.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity:** Emphasize the simplicity and ease of use of the slingshot design, highlighting the minimal number of components and the straightforward loading mechanism.
2. **Showcase the weight reduction:** Highlight the use of lighter materials and the compact design, demonstrating how these features minimize the weight of the slingshot.
3. **Discuss the energy storage:** Explain the ratchet mechanism and how it stores energy in the slingshot, allowing the user to load the projectile with a consistent force.

By focusing on simplicity, weight reduction, and energy storage, the simple slingshot design would differ significantly from the Aerius design, with a greater emphasis on ease of use and portability.
