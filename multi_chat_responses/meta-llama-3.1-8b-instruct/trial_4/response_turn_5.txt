**Design Document: High-Performance Slingshot for Maximum Force Output**

**Device Overview:**
Our high-performance slingshot design is optimized for maximum force output, utilizing a combination of advanced materials and precise measurements to achieve exceptional performance.

**Materials:**

* **Frame:** 6061-T6 Aluminum (density: 2.7 g/cm³)
* **Elastic (Rubber Band):** High-tension rubber (1.5 mm thick, 50 mm wide)
* **Projectile:** Lightweight plastic (polycarbonate or ABS)
* **Pivoting Yoke:** 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick aluminum rod
* **Ratchet Mechanism:** Steel gears with a 1:10 gear ratio

**Measurements:**

* **Frame:**
	+ Height: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Width: 6 inches (15.2 cm)
	+ Depth: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
	+ Thickness: 1/8 inch (3.18 mm)
* **Elastic (Rubber Band):**
	+ Length: 30 inches (76.2 cm)
	+ Stiffness: 150 N/mm (21.5 lbf/in)
	+ Energy Storage: 180 J (approximately 42 ft-lbs)
* **Projectile:**
	+ Mass: 15 grams (0.53 oz)
	+ Shape: Spherical (diameter: 2 cm or 0.8 in)
	+ Aerodynamics: Streamlined shape with a low drag coefficient (Cd ≈ 0.2)
* **Pivoting Yoke:**
	+ Length: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Diameter: 1/4 inch (6.35 mm)
* **Ratchet Mechanism:**
	+ Gear ratio: 1:10
	+ Gear size: 1 inch (2.54 cm) diameter

**Calculations:**

1. **Elastic Force:**
	* Stiffness (k) = 150 N/mm = 21.5 lbf/in
	* Energy Storage (E) = 180 J = 42 ft-lbs
	* Elastic Force (F_elastic) = √(2 \* k \* E) = 150 N (approximately 34 lbf)
2. **Projectile Acceleration:**
	* Mass (m) = 15 grams = 0.53 oz
	* Acceleration (a) = F_elastic / m = 10 m/s² (approximately 21 ft/s²)
3. **Total Force:**
	* Total Force (F_total) = F_elastic + F_projectile = 150 N + 15 N (approximately 34 lbf + 3.4 lbf) = 153 N (approximately 34.5 lbf)

**Rationale:**
Our design maximizes force output by utilizing a high-stiffness rubber band, a lightweight projectile, and a precise ratchet mechanism. The 6061-T6 Aluminum frame provides a strong and durable structure, while the pivoting yoke and ratchet mechanism ensure smooth and consistent loading.

**Conclusion:**
Our high-performance slingshot design is optimized for maximum force output, with a total force of approximately 153 N (34.5 lbf). This design is sure to impress the judges and provide a competitive edge in the competition.
