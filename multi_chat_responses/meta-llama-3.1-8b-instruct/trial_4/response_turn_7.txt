Using rock or steel balls instead of a lightweight plastic projectile would significantly increase the potential for injury or damage. Here's why:

1. **Mass:** Rock or steel balls would be much heavier than the lightweight plastic projectile, potentially causing more severe injuries or damage upon impact.
2. **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of the projectile would increase exponentially with its mass, potentially exceeding the safety cap of 60J. For example, a 1 kg steel ball traveling at 20 m/s would have a kinetic energy of approximately 400 J, which is well above the safety cap.
3. **Impact Force:** The impact force of a rock or steel ball would be much higher than that of a lightweight plastic projectile, potentially causing more severe damage or injury.

To estimate the kinetic energy of a rock or steel ball, we can use the following formula:

Kinetic Energy (KE) = (1/2) \* m \* v^2

where m is the mass of the projectile and v is its velocity.

Assuming a velocity of 20 m/s (approximately 45 mph), the kinetic energy of a 1 kg steel ball would be:

KE = (1/2) \* 1 kg \* (20 m/s)^2 = 400 J

This is well above the safety cap of 60J.

To ensure safety, it's essential to use a lightweight projectile with a low kinetic energy, such as the original design with a plastic projectile. If you need to use a heavier projectile, consider reducing the velocity or using a more energy-absorbing material to mitigate the impact force.

In summary, using rock or steel balls instead of a lightweight plastic projectile would increase the potential for injury or damage and likely exceed the safety cap of 60J. It's essential to use a safe and suitable projectile design to ensure the well-being of users and bystanders.
