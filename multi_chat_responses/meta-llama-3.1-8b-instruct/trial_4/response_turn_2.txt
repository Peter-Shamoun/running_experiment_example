**Scaling the Main Structural Frame:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an average adult user (around 5'10" height), consider the following dimensions for the main structural frame:

1. **Height:** 48-52 inches (122-132 cm) to accommodate a comfortable standing position and allow for easy access to the crank and guidance system.
2. **Width:** 24-28 inches (61-71 cm) to provide a stable base and allow for easy maneuverability.
3. **Depth:** 18-22 inches (46-56 cm) to accommodate the flywheel, pneumatic system, and guidance system components.

These dimensions will provide a comfortable working space for the user while allowing for a compact and efficient design.

**Suitable Material:**

For the main structural frame, consider using **6061-T6 Aluminum**. This alloy offers an excellent balance of strength, corrosion resistance, and machinability.

**Key Properties:**

* Tensile strength: 45,000-50,000 psi (310-345 MPa)
* Yield strength: 30,000-35,000 psi (205-240 MPa)
* Elongation at break: 12-15%
* Density: 2.7 g/cm³
* Corrosion resistance: Good resistance to atmospheric corrosion and some resistance to seawater corrosion

**Engineering Rationale and Stress Considerations:**

Under simulated loads, the main structural frame will be subjected to various stresses, including:

1. **Tensile stresses:** Due to the user's weight and the weight of the flywheel, pneumatic system, and guidance system components.
2. **Compressive stresses:** Due to the user's weight and any external loads (e.g., wind or accidental impacts).
3. **Shear stresses:** Due to the rotational motion of the flywheel and the pneumatic system.

To ensure the structural integrity of the main frame, consider the following:

1. **Minimum wall thickness:** 1/8 inch (3.18 mm) to provide sufficient strength and stiffness.
2. **Cross-sectional area:** Ensure the frame's cross-sectional area is sufficient to resist the expected stresses, using the following formulas:
	* Tensile stress: σ = F/A, where F is the applied force and A is the cross-sectional area.
	* Compressive stress: σ = F/A, where F is the applied force and A is the cross-sectional area.
	* Shear stress: τ = F/A, where F is the applied force and A is the cross-sectional area.
3. **Material selection:** Choose a material with a high strength-to-weight ratio, such as 6061-T6 Aluminum, to minimize the weight of the main frame while maintaining its structural integrity.

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

Assuming a user weight of 150 lbs (68 kg) and a flywheel weight of 20 lbs (9 kg), estimate the stresses on the main frame:

1. **Tensile stress:** σ = (150 lbs + 20 lbs) / (0.125 in \* 24 in) ≈ 10,000 psi (69 MPa)
2. **Compressive stress:** σ = (150 lbs + 20 lbs) / (0.125 in \* 24 in) ≈ 10,000 psi (69 MPa)
3. **Shear stress:** τ = (150 lbs \* 0.5 ft) / (0.125 in \* 24 in) ≈ 2,500 psi (17 MPa)

These estimates provide a rough idea of the stresses on the main frame. However, a more detailed analysis, including finite element modeling and dynamic simulations, would be necessary to accurately determine the stresses and ensure the structural integrity of the design.

For your contest presentation, focus on highlighting the key design decisions, material selection, and stress considerations that ensure the structural integrity of the main frame.
