Let's flesh out the simple slingshot design with the following components:

**Frame:**

* **Material:** 6063-T5 Aluminum (density: 2.7 g/cm³)
* **Dimensions:**
	+ Height: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Width: 6 inches (15.2 cm)
	+ Depth: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
* **Thickness:** 1/8 inch (3.18 mm)
* **Engineering Rationale:** The frame's dimensions and thickness are optimized for a balance between strength, stiffness, and weight. The 6063-T5 Aluminum material provides a good strength-to-weight ratio, making it suitable for the frame.

**Elastic (Rubber Band):**

* **Material:** High-tension rubber (e.g., 1.5 mm thick, 50 mm wide)
* **Length:** 24 inches (61 cm)
* **Stiffness:** 100 N/mm (14.5 lbf/in)
* **Energy Storage:** 120 J (approximately 28 ft-lbs)
* **Engineering Rationale:** The rubber band's stiffness and energy storage capacity are optimized for a high-performance slingshot. The high-tension rubber provides a good balance between energy storage and elastic limit.

**Projectile:**

* **Material:** Lightweight plastic (e.g., polycarbonate or ABS)
* **Mass:** 10 grams (0.35 oz)
* **Shape:** Spherical (diameter: 1.5 cm or 0.6 in)
* **Aerodynamics:** Streamlined shape with a low drag coefficient (Cd ≈ 0.2)
* **Engineering Rationale:** The projectile's mass and shape are optimized for a balance between aerodynamics and energy transfer. The lightweight plastic material provides a good strength-to-weight ratio, while the spherical shape minimizes drag.

**Measurement and Sensors:**

* **Distance Measurement:** Laser rangefinder (accuracy: ±1 cm or ±0.4 in)
* **Velocity Measurement:** Doppler radar (accuracy: ±1 m/s or ±2.2 mph)
* **Angle Measurement:** Inertial measurement unit (IMU) with a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope (accuracy: ±1°)
* **Engineering Rationale:** The measurement and sensor suite is designed to provide accurate and reliable data for the contest. The laser rangefinder and Doppler radar provide precise distance and velocity measurements, while the IMU provides accurate angle measurements.

**Other Components:**

* **Pivoting Yoke:** 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick aluminum rod with a pivot point at the center of the frame
* **Ratchet Mechanism:** Simple ratchet mechanism with a 1:10 gear ratio to store energy in the rubber band
* **Engineering Rationale:** The pivoting yoke and ratchet mechanism are designed to provide a smooth and consistent loading experience for the user.

This design provides a solid foundation for a high-performance slingshot. The frame, elastic, and projectile are optimized for a balance between strength, stiffness, and weight, while the measurement and sensor suite provides accurate and reliable data for the contest.
