Using rock or steel balls with the HPS-MPV design would be extremely unsafe. Here's why:

1. **Energy Transfer:** The HPS-MPV design is optimized for high-energy transfer, which means it can store and release a significant amount of energy. Using rock or steel balls would increase the energy transfer even further, potentially leading to catastrophic failures or injuries.
2. **Projectile Mass:** Rock or steel balls are much heavier than the aluminum alloy projectile used in the original design. This would increase the kinetic energy of the projectile, making it even more hazardous.
3. **Impact Velocity:** The HPS-MPV design is capable of launching projectiles at high velocities. Using rock or steel balls would increase the impact velocity, making the projectile even more destructive.
4. **Safety Cap:** The 60J safety cap is a conservative estimate, and using rock or steel balls would likely exceed this value. In fact, the kinetic energy of the projectile would be significantly higher than 60J, potentially exceeding 100J or more.

To estimate the kinetic energy of the projectile, we can use the following formula:

Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0.5 \* m \* v^2

where m is the mass of the projectile and v is its velocity.

Assuming a rock or steel ball with a mass of 100g (3.5 oz) and a velocity of 200 m/s (447 mph), the kinetic energy would be:

KE = 0.5 \* 0.1 kg \* (200 m/s)^2
= 20,000 J

This is an extremely high value, far exceeding the 60J safety cap. In reality, the actual kinetic energy would be even higher due to the increased mass and velocity of the projectile.

In conclusion, using rock or steel balls with the HPS-MPV design would be extremely unsafe and potentially catastrophic. The design is not suitable for use with heavy or hard projectiles, and the safety cap of 60J should be taken seriously.
