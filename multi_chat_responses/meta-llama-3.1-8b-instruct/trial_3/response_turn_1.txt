Here's a high-level conceptual idea for a human-powered projectile launcher that stands out:

**Name:** "Aerius"

**Core Subsystems:**

1. **Human Power Amplification System (HPAS):** A custom-designed, high-efficiency crank-and-pulley system that amplifies the user's input energy by leveraging a combination of mechanical advantage and elastic energy storage.
2. **Air-Bearing Launch Tube (ABLT):** A precision-crafted, aerodynamically optimized launch tube with a smooth, air-bearing surface that minimizes friction and enables high-speed, low-drag projectile flight.
3. **Precision Guidance and Control (PGC) System:** A sophisticated, computer-controlled system that utilizes sensors, algorithms, and actuators to optimize projectile trajectory, stabilize the launch tube, and ensure repeatable performance.

**Why Aerius excels in contest scoring:**

1. **Energy Efficiency:** The HPAS subsystem enables high energy transfer from the user to the projectile, while minimizing energy losses due to friction and inefficiencies.
2. **Precision and Repeatability:** The PGC system ensures consistent, accurate launches, while the ABLT minimizes aerodynamic drag and enables high-speed flight.
3. **Scalability:** The design allows for easy modification and optimization of the HPAS and PGC subsystems to accommodate different projectile masses and sizes.

**Key tradeoffs to consider:**

1. **Complexity vs. Simplicity:** The PGC system adds complexity, but enables high precision and repeatability. A simpler design might compromise on these metrics.
2. **Mass vs. Energy Efficiency:** The HPAS subsystem requires a significant amount of mass to achieve high energy transfer. This might impact the overall system's portability and ease of use.
3. **Cost vs. Performance:** The use of high-precision components and advanced materials in the ABLT and PGC subsystems might increase costs. However, the potential gains in performance and accuracy might justify the investment.

**Presentation tips:**

1. **Highlight the innovative HPAS subsystem:** Emphasize the unique design and its potential for high energy transfer and efficiency.
2. **Showcase the precision and repeatability of the PGC system:** Use data and visualizations to demonstrate the system's accuracy and consistency.
3. **Discuss the scalability and adaptability of the design:** Explain how the system can be modified to accommodate different projectile types and sizes.

This conceptual idea should provide a solid foundation for your team's brainstorming and design process. Good luck with the contest!
