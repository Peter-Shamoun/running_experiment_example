Let's create a high-performance slingshot design, integrating the material, elastic, projectile, and measurement choices we've discussed.

**Slingshot Design: "Apex"**

**Frame:**

* **Material:** Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) with a high-strength, low-weight profile
* **Dimensions:**
	+ Length: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Width: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
	+ Height: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
* **Geometry:** A Y-shaped frame with a curved, aerodynamic profile to reduce air resistance
* **Engineering Rationale:** The CFRP frame provides exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a compact and lightweight design. The curved profile reduces air resistance, maximizing the slingshot's range.

**Elastic Band:**

* **Material:** High-strength, low-stretch rubber (e.g., Kevlar-reinforced rubber)
* **Properties:**
	+ Tensile strength: 300 MPa
	+ Young's modulus: 100 MPa
	+ Elongation at break: 200%
* **Dimensions:** 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide, 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) thick, and 12 inches (30.5 cm) long
* **Engineering Rationale:** The high-strength, low-stretch rubber provides exceptional energy storage and release, while the Kevlar reinforcement enhances durability and resistance to wear.

**Projectile:**

* **Material:** Lightweight, high-strength metal (e.g., aluminum or titanium)
* **Shape:** A streamlined, aerodynamic shape with a rounded nose and a flat base
* **Dimensions:** 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter, 2 inches (5.1 cm) length
* **Mass:** 20 grams
* **Engineering Rationale:** The lightweight metal and streamlined shape minimize air resistance, maximizing the projectile's range. The flat base provides stability and prevents the projectile from tumbling.

**Measurement and Control:**

* **Gauge:** A precision, digital gauge measures the elastic band's tension and provides real-time feedback to the user
* **Control System:** A simple, user-friendly control system allows the user to adjust the elastic band's tension and optimize the slingshot's performance

**Engineering Rationale:**

* **Stress Loads:** The CFRP frame and elastic band are designed to withstand the stresses generated by the user's grip and the projectile's launch. The high-strength, low-stretch rubber ensures that the elastic band stores energy efficiently and releases it quickly.
* **Energy Storage:** The elastic band's high tensile strength and low elongation at break enable it to store a significant amount of energy, which is then released rapidly to propel the projectile.
* **Precision:** The streamlined projectile shape and the precision gauge provide accurate measurements and control, allowing the user to optimize the slingshot's performance and achieve consistent results.

This design prioritizes raw distance metrics, leveraging the streamlined mechanics and high-performance materials to create a competitive slingshot. By optimizing the elastic band's properties, projectile shape, and control system, the Apex slingshot is poised to deliver exceptional performance in the contest.
