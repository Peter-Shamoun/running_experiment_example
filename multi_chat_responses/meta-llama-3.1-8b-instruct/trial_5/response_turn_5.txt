**Design Document: "Apex Force Optimizer"**

**Introduction:**
The Apex Force Optimizer is a high-performance slingshot designed to maximize force output. This document outlines the design, materials, and calculations to achieve the highest possible force output.

**Design Overview:**

The Apex Force Optimizer consists of a Y-shaped frame, an elastic band, and a projectile. The frame is made of high-strength, lightweight carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The elastic band is a high-strength, low-stretch rubber (Kevlar-reinforced rubber). The projectile is a lightweight, high-strength metal (aluminum or titanium).

**Materials and Measurements:**

* **CFRP Frame:**
	+ Length: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Width: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
	+ Height: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
	+ Thickness: 0.1 inches (0.25 cm)
* **Elastic Band:**
	+ Width: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
	+ Thickness: 0.25 inches (0.64 cm)
	+ Length: 12 inches (30.5 cm)
	+ Tensile strength: 300 MPa
	+ Young's modulus: 100 MPa
	+ Elongation at break: 200%
* **Projectile:**
	+ Diameter: 1 inch (2.5 cm)
	+ Length: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
	+ Mass: 20 grams
	+ Material: Aluminum or Titanium

**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force output, we need to calculate the force generated by each component and add them together.

1. **Elastic Band Force:**
The elastic band's force output can be calculated using the formula:

F = (k \* x)

where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.

Assuming a displacement of 0.5 inches (1.27 cm), we can calculate the spring constant:

k = (tensile strength \* area) / displacement
= (300 MPa \* 2 inches \* 2 inches) / 0.5 inches
= 4800 N/m

Now, we can calculate the force output:

F = (k \* x)
= (4800 N/m \* 0.5 inches)
= 2400 N

2. **Projectile Force:**
The projectile's force output can be calculated using the formula:

F = (m \* v^2) / r

where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the projectile.

Assuming a velocity of 100 m/s and a radius of 0.5 inches (1.27 cm), we can calculate the force output:

F = (m \* v^2) / r
= (20 grams \* (100 m/s)^2) / 0.5 inches
= 400 N

3. **Total Force Output:**
The total force output is the sum of the elastic band force and the projectile force:

Total Force Output = Elastic Band Force + Projectile Force
= 2400 N + 400 N
= 2800 N

**Conclusion:**
The Apex Force Optimizer is a high-performance slingshot designed to maximize force output. With a total force output of 2800 N, this design is poised to win the competition. The use of high-strength, lightweight materials and optimized measurements ensures that the elastic band and projectile work together to generate maximum force output.
