For a simple slingshot design, the approach would be quite different from the Aerius launcher. Here's a high-level overview of the design considerations:

**Simple Slingshot Design:**

1. **Structural Frame**: A simple slingshot typically consists of a Y-shaped frame with a pouch or pocket for holding the projectile. The frame is usually made of a flexible material, such as wood, plastic, or metal.
2. **Pouch and Projectile**: The pouch is designed to hold the projectile securely, and the user's fingers are placed on either side of the pouch to generate tension.
3. **Tensioning Mechanism**: The user generates tension by stretching the rubber band or elastic material, which stores energy.
4. **Launch Mechanism**: When the user releases the projectile, the stored energy is rapidly released, propelling the projectile forward.

**Design Considerations:**

1. **Material Selection**: For a simple slingshot, a flexible material like rubber, plastic, or wood is suitable. The material should be able to store energy and release it quickly.
2. **Geometry and Ergonomics**: The slingshot's geometry and ergonomics are critical for comfortable use and efficient energy storage. The Y-shaped frame should be designed to fit comfortably in the user's hand.
3. **Tensioning and Launch**: The tensioning mechanism should be designed to store energy efficiently, and the launch mechanism should be designed to release the energy quickly and consistently.
4. **Safety**: The slingshot should be designed with safety in mind, including features like a secure pouch and a mechanism to prevent accidental launches.

**Key Tradeoffs:**

1. **Energy Storage**: Simple slingshots rely on elastic materials to store energy, which can be less efficient than the flywheel-based energy storage in the Aerius launcher.
2. **Precision**: Simple slingshots are generally less precise than the Aerius launcher, as they rely on the user's aim and technique.
3. **Scalability**: Simple slingshots are often designed for a specific projectile size and weight, making them less scalable than the Aerius launcher.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity**: Emphasize the simplicity and elegance of the simple slingshot design, which makes it accessible and user-friendly.
2. **Discuss the tradeoffs**: Explain the tradeoffs between energy storage, precision, and scalability, and how they impact the design.
3. **Showcase the user experience**: Use demonstrations or simulations to show how the simple slingshot works and how it can be used effectively.

By understanding the design considerations and tradeoffs for a simple slingshot, you can create a compelling presentation that showcases the unique aspects of this design.
