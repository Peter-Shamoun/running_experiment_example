Let's scale the dimensions of the Aerius launcher to fit an average adult user.

**Ergonomic Scaling:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency, we'll aim to position the user's hands and body in a comfortable, natural position. Here's a suggested scaling:

1. **Height**: The overall height of the launcher should be around 60-70 inches (152-178 cm) to accommodate the user's height and allow for a comfortable reach.
2. **Crank Radius**: The crank radius should be around 12-15 inches (30-38 cm) to allow for a comfortable grip and leverage.
3. **Flywheel Diameter**: The flywheel diameter should be around 18-22 inches (45-55 cm) to provide a stable and efficient energy storage system.
4. **Air Tank Length**: The air tank length should be around 24-30 inches (61-76 cm) to accommodate the stored energy and provide a stable platform for the pneumatic launch system.

**Material Selection:**

For the main structural frame, I recommend using a high-strength, lightweight material like **Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)**. CFRP offers an excellent balance of strength, stiffness, and weight, making it ideal for a high-performance launcher.

**Key Properties of CFRP:**

* Tensile strength: 300-400 MPa
* Compressive strength: 200-300 MPa
* Young's modulus: 100-150 GPa
* Density: 1.8-2.0 g/cm³

**Engineering Rationale and Stress Considerations:**

Under simulated loads, the launcher will experience various stresses, including:

1. **Tensile stresses**: Due to the user's grip and crank force, the crank and flywheel will experience tensile stresses. CFRP's high tensile strength will help mitigate these stresses.
2. **Compressive stresses**: The air tank and launcher body will experience compressive stresses due to the stored energy and launch forces. CFRP's compressive strength will help maintain the structure's integrity.
3. **Bending stresses**: The launcher will experience bending stresses due to the user's grip and launch forces. CFRP's high stiffness and Young's modulus will help minimize these stresses.

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

Assuming a user-generated force of 100 N (22.5 lbf) and a crank radius of 15 inches, the maximum tensile stress in the crank can be estimated as:

σ = F / A = 100 N / (π \* (0.15 m)^2) ≈ 21.5 MPa

Using CFRP's tensile strength (300 MPa), the safety factor is approximately 14:1, indicating a conservative design.

For the air tank, assuming a stored energy of 100 J and a length of 25 inches, the maximum compressive stress can be estimated as:

σ = P / A = 100 J / (π \* (0.25 m)^2) ≈ 12.7 MPa

Using CFRP's compressive strength (250 MPa), the safety factor is approximately 20:1, indicating a conservative design.

These calculations provide a basic understanding of the stresses involved and demonstrate the suitability of CFRP for the launcher's structural frame. However, please note that these are simplified estimates and actual stress calculations should be performed using detailed finite element analysis or experimental testing.
