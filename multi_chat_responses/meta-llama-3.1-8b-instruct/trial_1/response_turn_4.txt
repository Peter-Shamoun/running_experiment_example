Let's develop a detailed blueprint for the high-performance simple slingshot design, incorporating the material, elastic, projectile, and measurement choices we've discussed.

**Slingshot Blueprint:**

**Frame:**

* **Material:** Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) with a density of 1.8 g/cm³
* **Dimensions:**
	+ Height: 10 inches (25.4 cm)
	+ Width: 4 inches (10.2 cm)
	+ Thickness: 0.25 inches (6.4 mm)
* **Engineering Rationale:** The CFRP frame provides a high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a compact and lightweight design while maintaining structural integrity.

**Elastic:**

* **Material:** High-tenacity rubber with a Young's modulus of 10 MPa
* **Properties:**
	+ Elastic modulus: 10 MPa
	+ Tensile strength: 20 MPa
	+ Damping ratio: 0.05
* **Engineering Rationale:** The high-tenacity rubber provides a high elastic modulus, allowing for efficient energy storage and release. The tensile strength ensures that the elastic can withstand the stresses imposed by the user.

**Projectile:**

* **Material:** Aluminum alloy with a density of 2.7 g/cm³
* **Dimensions:**
	+ Length: 2 inches (5.1 cm)
	+ Diameter: 0.5 inches (1.3 cm)
	+ Mass: 10 grams
* **Engineering Rationale:** The aluminum alloy projectile provides a high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a compact and lightweight design while maintaining structural integrity.

**Measurement Choices:**

* **Band width:** 1 inch (2.5 cm)
* **Band thickness:** 0.1 inches (2.5 mm)
* **Pouch size:** 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) diameter
* **Pouch material:** Same as the elastic material (high-tenacity rubber)

**Theoretical Optimization:**

To optimize the slingshot design, we'll focus on the following parameters:

1. **Elastic energy storage:** Maximize the elastic energy stored in the rubber band.
2. **Projectile velocity:** Maximize the projectile velocity at launch.
3. **Precision:** Minimize the spread of the projectile's trajectory.

We'll use a combination of mathematical modeling and simulation to optimize the design. For now, let's focus on the following key parameters:

1. **Elastic band length:** 10 inches (25.4 cm)
2. **Elastic band tension:** 20 N (4.5 lbf)
3. **Projectile mass:** 10 grams
4. **Pouch size:** 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) diameter

These parameters will serve as a starting point for our optimization modeling. We can then use simulation tools to explore the design space and identify the optimal values for each parameter.

**Engineering Rationale:**

The theoretical optimization of the slingshot design is driven by the need to maximize elastic energy storage, projectile velocity, and precision. By carefully selecting the material, elastic, projectile, and measurement choices, we can create a high-performance slingshot that excels in raw distance metrics.

Please note that this is a simplified model, and actual design and testing may require more complex analysis and experimentation. However, this blueprint provides a solid foundation for our optimization modeling and can be used as a starting point for further refinement.
