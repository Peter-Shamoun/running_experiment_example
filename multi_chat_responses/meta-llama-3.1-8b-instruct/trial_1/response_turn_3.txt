USER PROMPT:
Perfect! Now for the physics calculations: with those elastic band specs at a 30 inch draw what would be the peak draw force in Newtons? And if we achieve 120J of stored energy with 75% transfer efficiency what would be the kinetic energy output to a 40g projectile? Can you also calculate the resulting projectile velocity? We need these numbers for our lab report.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Here are the calculations for the peak draw force and kinetic energy output:

**Peak Draw Force:**

*   The elastic band's energy storage can be calculated using the formula: Energy (J) = 0.5 \* k \* x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.
*   The spring constant (k) can be calculated using the formula: k = (F / x), where F is the force and x is the displacement.
*   Assuming a 30 inch draw, the displacement (x) is 0.762 meters (30 inches \* 0.0254 meters/inch).
*   The energy stored in the elastic band is 120 J, so we can calculate the spring constant (k) as follows: k = (2 \* energy) / x^2 = (2 \* 120 J) / (0.762 m)^2 = 394 N/m.
*   The peak draw force (F) can be calculated using the formula: F = k \* x = 394 N/m \* 0.762 m = 300 N.

**Kinetic Energy Output:**

*   The kinetic energy output can be calculated using the formula: Kinetic Energy (J) = (1 - efficiency) \* energy stored, where efficiency is the percentage of energy transferred to the projectile.
*   Assuming a 75% transfer efficiency, the kinetic energy output is: Kinetic Energy (J) = (1 - 0.75) \* 120 J = 30 J.
*   The kinetic energy output to a 40g projectile can be calculated using the formula: Kinetic Energy (J) = (1/2) \* m \* v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.
*   Rearranging the formula to solve for velocity, we get: v = sqrt((2 \* kinetic energy) / m) = sqrt((2 \* 30 J) / (0.04 kg)) = 35.35 m/s.

**Projectile Velocity:**

*   The resulting projectile velocity is 35.35 m/s.

These calculations provide the necessary information for your lab report, including the peak draw force, kinetic energy output, and projectile velocity.
