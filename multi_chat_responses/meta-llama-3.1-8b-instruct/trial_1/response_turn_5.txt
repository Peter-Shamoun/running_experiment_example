**High-Performance Slingshot Design**

**Objective:** Maximize the force output of the slingshot design to achieve the highest possible distance and precision.

**Design Overview:**

Our high-performance slingshot design consists of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) frame, a high-tenacity rubber elastic band, and an aluminum alloy projectile. The design is optimized for maximum force output, with a focus on efficient energy storage and release.

**Materials:**

* **CFRP Frame:** 1.8 g/cm³ density, 300,000 psi tensile strength
* **High-Tenacity Rubber Elastic Band:** 10 MPa elastic modulus, 20 MPa tensile strength
* **Aluminum Alloy Projectile:** 2.7 g/cm³ density, 300,000 psi tensile strength

**Measurements:**

* **Elastic Band Length:** 12 inches (30.5 cm)
* **Elastic Band Width:** 1.5 inches (3.8 cm)
* **Elastic Band Thickness:** 0.2 inches (5.1 mm)
* **Projectile Mass:** 15 grams
* **Projectile Diameter:** 0.6 inches (1.5 cm)
* **Pouch Size:** 2 inches (5.1 cm) diameter
* **Pouch Material:** Same as the elastic band material (high-tenacity rubber)

**Calculations:**

To calculate the total force generated by the design, we'll break it down into individual components:

1. **Elastic Band Force:**
	* Elastic band stress: 20 MPa (tensile strength) / 0.2 inches (5.1 mm) = 100 MPa
	* Elastic band force: 100 MPa \* 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) \* 12 inches (30.5 cm) = 18,000 N (4,000 lbf)
2. **Projectile Acceleration:**
	* Projectile mass: 15 grams
	* Elastic band force: 18,000 N (4,000 lbf)
	* Projectile acceleration: 18,000 N / 15 grams = 1,200 m/s² (124 g)
3. **Total Force:**
	* Total force = Elastic band force + Projectile acceleration force
	* Total force = 18,000 N (4,000 lbf) + 1,200 N (270 lbf) = 19,200 N (4,270 lbf)

**Rationale:**

Our design optimizes the force output by:

* Using a high-strength CFRP frame to minimize weight and maximize structural integrity
* Selecting a high-tenacity rubber elastic band with a high elastic modulus and tensile strength
* Designing the elastic band with a longer length and wider width to increase the force output
* Using an aluminum alloy projectile with a high tensile strength to minimize weight and maximize structural integrity

**Conclusion:**

Our high-performance slingshot design is optimized for maximum force output, with a total force of 19,200 N (4,270 lbf). This design should achieve the highest possible distance and precision in the competition.
