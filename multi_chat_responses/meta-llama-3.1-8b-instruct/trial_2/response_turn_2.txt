USER PROMPT:
Thanks for the detailed start! However I should clarify: this is specifically a Y-frame handheld slingshot design not a larger frame. Can you revise with: 1) Y-shaped frame with two fork arms and handle suitable for adult hand grip 2) Fork gap width and fork height dimensions 3) Steel ball bearing projectile (spherical) not plate 4) Latex tubing or flat bands not generic rubber 5) Total frame weight 6) Band attachment method. Please provide corrected specifications for a standard Y-frame slingshot configuration.

MODEL RESPONSE:
Here are the revised specifications for a standard Y-frame slingshot configuration:

**Frame Material and Dimensions:**

* Frame material: High-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel (e.g., ASTM A572 Gr. 50)
* Frame dimensions:
	+ Length: 180 mm (7.09 in)
	+ Width: 80 mm (3.15 in)
	+ Height: 50 mm (1.97 in)
	+ Thickness: 3 mm (0.118 in)
* Frame geometry:
	+ Y-frame angle: 120° between the two fork arms
	+ Handle angle: 30° between the handle and the fork arms

**Fork Geometry:**

* Fork material: Same as the frame material (HSLA steel)
* Fork dimensions:
	+ Fork gap width: 20 mm (0.787 in)
	+ Fork height: 30 mm (1.18 in)
	+ Fork thickness: 2 mm (0.079 in)
* Fork geometry:
	+ Curvature: 50 mm (1.97 in) radius of curvature for the fork arms
	+ Angle: 45° between the fork arms and the handle

**Handle Dimensions:**

* Handle material: Same as the frame material (HSLA steel)
* Handle dimensions:
	+ Length: 80 mm (3.15 in)
	+ Width: 20 mm (0.787 in)
	+ Thickness: 3 mm (0.118 in)
* Handle geometry:
	+ Contour: Ergonomic, curved shape to fit an adult hand

**Projectile Parameters:**

* Projectile material: Steel ball bearing (spherical)
* Projectile dimensions:
	+ Diameter: 12 mm (0.472 in)
	+ Weight: 10 grams (0.35 oz)
* Projectile aerodynamics:
	+ Drag coefficient (Cd): 0.5
	+ Lift coefficient (Cl): 0

**Elastic Band Specifications:**

* Elastic band material: Latex tubing (e.g., 1/4" ID x 1/2" OD x 12" long)
* Elastic band properties:
	+ Young's modulus: 10 MPa (1450 psi)
	+ Tensile strength: 20 MPa (2900 psi)
	+ Strain at break: 300%

**Band Attachment Method:**

* Band attachment method: Rubber bands are attached to the fork arms using small metal clips (e.g., 1/4" x 1/2" x 1/8" thick).

**Total Frame Weight:**

* Estimated total frame weight: 250 grams (8.82 oz)

**Performance Calculations:**

1. **Energy Storage:**
	* Elastic band energy storage: Calculate the energy stored in the elastic band using the formula: Energy = 0.5 \* k \* x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement.
	* Spring constant (k): Calculate the spring constant using the formula: k = (E \* A) / (3 \* L), where E is the Young's modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length of the elastic band.
	* Displacement (x): Calculate the displacement using the formula: x = (F \* L) / (E \* A), where F is the force applied to the elastic band.
2. **Projectile Velocity:**
	* Calculate the projectile velocity using the formula: v = sqrt(2 \* E / m), where E is the energy stored in the elastic band and m is the mass of the projectile.
3. **Range and Accuracy:**
	* Calculate the range using the formula: R = (v^2 \* sin(2θ)) / g, where θ is the angle of launch and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
	* Calculate the accuracy using the formula: Accuracy = (R \* sin(θ)) / (2 \* v), where R is the range and v is the projectile velocity.

Please note that these specifications are for a standard Y-frame slingshot configuration and can be adjusted based on your specific design requirements and constraints.
