**Device Name:** High-Performance Slingshot (HPS)

**Objective:** Maximize the force output of the HPS to achieve the highest possible range and accuracy.

**Design Overview:**

The HPS consists of a high-strength frame, a high-performance elastic, and a precision-crafted projectile. The device is designed to store energy in the elastic, which is then rapidly released to propel the projectile.

**Materials:**

1. **Frame:** High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) with a tensile strength of 30 MPa
2. **Elastic:** High-Performance Rubber (HPR) with an elastic modulus of 20 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 80 MPa
3. **Projectile:** Aluminum (6061-T6) with a tensile strength of 290 MPa

**Measurements:**

1. **Frame:**
	* Width: 8 inches (20.32 cm)
	* Height: 6 inches (15.24 cm)
	* Thickness: 1 inch (2.54 cm)
2. **Elastic:**
	* Width: 1 inch (2.54 cm)
	* Length: 12 inches (30.48 cm)
	* Thickness: 0.2 inches (5.08 mm)
3. **Projectile:**
	* Diameter: 1.5 inches (3.81 cm)
	* Length: 6 inches (15.24 cm)

**Rationale:**

The frame is designed to be as strong as possible while minimizing weight. The elastic is chosen for its high elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength, ensuring efficient energy storage and release. The projectile is made of aluminum for its high strength-to-weight ratio.

**Calculations:**

1. **Elastic Force:**
	* Elastic force (F_elastic) = elastic modulus (E) x cross-sectional area (A) x strain (ε)
	* F_elastic = 20 MPa x (1 in x 12 in) x 0.2 in = 480 N (108 lbf)
2. **Projectile Force:**
	* Projectile force (F_projectile) = tensile strength (σ) x cross-sectional area (A)
	* F_projectile = 290 MPa x (π x (1.5 in)^2 / 4) = 1335 N (300 lbf)
3. **Total Force:**
	* Total force (F_total) = F_elastic + F_projectile
	* F_total = 480 N + 1335 N = 1815 N (407 lbf)

**Conclusion:**

The HPS design is optimized for maximum force output, with a total force of 1815 N (407 lbf). This design should achieve the highest possible range and accuracy in the competition.

**Note:** The calculations above assume a 100% efficient energy transfer from the elastic to the projectile. In reality, some energy will be lost due to friction and other factors, so the actual force output may be lower.
