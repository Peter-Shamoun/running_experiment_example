For a simple slingshot design, the key differences would be:

**Key Design Considerations:**

1. **Energy Storage**: Instead of a flywheel, a simple slingshot relies on elastic energy stored in a rubber band or a spring.
2. **Energy Release**: The energy is released rapidly when the user pulls the trigger or releases the tension in the rubber band.
3. **Projectile Acceleration**: The projectile is accelerated by the stored energy, which is transferred to the projectile through the slingshot's frame.

**Structural Frame:**

For a simple slingshot, the structural frame would be designed to:

1. **Support the Rubber Band**: The frame would need to withstand the tensile stress imposed by the rubber band, which can be significant.
2. **Guide the Projectile**: The frame would need to guide the projectile smoothly and accurately, minimizing deflection and ensuring a consistent trajectory.
3. **Withstand User Forces**: The frame would need to withstand the forces imposed by the user's hands and fingers when pulling the trigger or releasing the tension.

**Material Selection:**

For a simple slingshot, a suitable material would be:

**High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)**

* **Density**: around 0.94-0.96 g/cmÂ³
* **Tensile Strength**: up to 40-50 MPa
* **Young's Modulus**: around 1-2 GPa
* **Cost**: relatively low

HDPE is a suitable choice for a simple slingshot due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to fatigue, and low cost.

**Basic Stress Considerations:**

Under simulated loads, a simple slingshot would experience:

1. **Tensile Stress**: due to the rubber band's tension
2. **Compressive Stress**: due to the user's forces on the frame
3. **Shear Stress**: due to the projectile's acceleration and deceleration

To ensure the structural integrity of the slingshot, we can apply basic stress considerations:

1. **Tensile Stress**: Ensure that the HDPE material can withstand the maximum tensile stress imposed by the rubber band. A safety factor of 2-3 is recommended.
2. **Compressive Stress**: Ensure that the slingshot's frame can withstand the maximum compressive stress imposed by the user's forces. A safety factor of 2-3 is recommended.
3. **Shear Stress**: Ensure that the slingshot's frame can withstand the maximum shear stress imposed by the projectile's acceleration and deceleration. A safety factor of 2-3 is recommended.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity**: Emphasize the simplicity of the slingshot design and its reliance on elastic energy storage.
2. **Showcase the material selection**: Explain the benefits of using HDPE, including its high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to fatigue.
3. **Discuss the stress considerations**: Explain the basic stress considerations that were applied to ensure the structural integrity of the slingshot, and highlight the safety factors used to ensure a safe and reliable design.
