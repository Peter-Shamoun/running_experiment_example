**Scaling the Main Structural Frame:**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an average adult user (around 5'10" height), I recommend scaling the main structural frame as follows:

1. **Crank Handle Height**: Position the crank handle at a height of approximately 30-35 inches (76-89 cm) above the floor, allowing the user to operate the crank with a slight bend in the elbow and a neutral wrist position.
2. **Flywheel Housing Diameter**: Design the flywheel housing to have a diameter of around 12-14 inches (30-35 cm), which will provide a comfortable grip for the user's hands and allow for a stable, low-speed operation.
3. **Pneumatic Launch System Barrel Length**: Position the pneumatic launch system barrel to be approximately 24-30 inches (61-76 cm) long, allowing the user to comfortably reach the launch trigger and maintain a safe distance from the projectile.
4. **Overall Frame Height**: Keep the overall frame height to around 48-52 inches (122-132 cm), ensuring the user can comfortably operate the device without straining their back or shoulders.

**Suitable Material:**

I recommend using **6061-T6 Aluminum** as the primary material for the main structural frame. This alloy offers an excellent balance of:

1. **Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: 6061-T6 aluminum has a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it an ideal choice for a human-powered launcher that needs to be both durable and lightweight.
2. **Corrosion Resistance**: The aluminum alloy provides excellent corrosion resistance, which is essential for a device that will be exposed to various environmental conditions.
3. **Machinability**: 6061-T6 aluminum is relatively easy to machine, allowing for precise fabrication and assembly.

**Engineering Rationale and Stress Considerations:**

Under simulated loads, the main structural frame will be subjected to various stresses, including:

1. **Torsional Stress**: The crank handle and flywheel housing will experience torsional stress due to the user's rotational motion. To mitigate this, use a robust crank handle design with a diameter of at least 1.5 inches (38 mm) and a flywheel housing with a thickness of at least 0.25 inches (6 mm).
2. **Bending Stress**: The pneumatic launch system barrel and surrounding frame will experience bending stress due to the projectile's acceleration. To minimize this, use a barrel with a diameter of at least 1 inch (25 mm) and a wall thickness of at least 0.125 inches (3 mm).
3. **Axial Stress**: The flywheel housing and surrounding frame will experience axial stress due to the stored energy. To manage this, use a flywheel housing with a thickness of at least 0.25 inches (6 mm) and a robust attachment system to the main frame.

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

Assuming a user input of 100 Nm (torque) and a flywheel rotational speed of 1000 rpm, the estimated stresses on the main structural frame are:

1. **Torsional Stress**: 100 Nm / (π \* 0.15 m) ≈ 210 MPa (30,000 psi)
2. **Bending Stress**: 1000 N \* 0.25 m / (π \* 0.0125 m^2) ≈ 50 MPa (7,200 psi)
3. **Axial Stress**: 1000 N \* 0.25 m / (π \* 0.006 m^2) ≈ 100 MPa (14,500 psi)

These stress estimates are purely for analysis and presentation purposes. In reality, the actual stresses will depend on various factors, including the user's input, flywheel design, and launch system configuration.
