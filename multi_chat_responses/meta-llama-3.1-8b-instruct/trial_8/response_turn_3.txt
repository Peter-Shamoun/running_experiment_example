For a simple slingshot design, the main structural frame would differ significantly from the Aerius concept. Here's a high-level overview of the design considerations:

**Simple Slingshot Design:**

1. **Frame Material**: A lightweight, yet strong material like **Carbon Fiber** or **Fiberglass** would be suitable for a slingshot frame. These materials offer a high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal for a compact, portable design.
2. **Frame Shape**: A simple slingshot frame would consist of a **Y-shaped** or **V-shaped** configuration, with the two arms meeting at a central point. This shape allows for a compact design and enables the user to easily load and aim the slingshot.
3. **Pouch and Strap**: The pouch would be designed to hold the projectile, and the strap would be used to store energy when the user pulls the pouch back. The strap would typically be made of a durable material like **leather** or **nylon**.
4. **Trigger and Release**: A simple trigger mechanism would be used to release the stored energy, allowing the projectile to fly forward. The trigger could be a simple **lever** or **button** design.

**Key Design Considerations:**

1. **Compactness**: A simple slingshot design needs to be compact and portable, making it easy to carry and use in various environments.
2. **Lightweight**: The frame and pouch should be lightweight to minimize fatigue and make the slingshot easy to maneuver.
3. **Durability**: The design should be able to withstand regular use and potential impacts from the projectile.
4. **Aiming and Accuracy**: The slingshot should be designed to allow for accurate aiming and shooting, with a comfortable grip and a smooth release mechanism.

**Stress Considerations:**

1. **Bending Stress**: The frame would experience bending stress due to the user's pulling force on the pouch. To mitigate this, use a robust frame design with a high strength-to-weight ratio.
2. **Tensile Stress**: The strap and pouch would experience tensile stress due to the user's pulling force. To manage this, use a durable material with a high tensile strength.
3. **Impact Stress**: The frame and pouch would experience impact stress due to the projectile's acceleration. To minimize this, use a robust design with a high impact resistance.

**Basic Stress Calculations:**

Assuming a user input of 50 N (tensile force) and a pouch material with a tensile strength of 100 MPa (14,500 psi), the estimated stresses on the slingshot frame are:

1. **Bending Stress**: 50 N \* 0.1 m / (π \* 0.01 m^2) ≈ 16 MPa (2,300 psi)
2. **Tensile Stress**: 50 N / (π \* 0.005 m^2) ≈ 32 MPa (4,600 psi)
3. **Impact Stress**: Assuming an impact force of 100 N, the estimated stress would be approximately 20 MPa (2,900 psi)

Keep in mind that these stress estimates are simplified and intended for analysis and presentation purposes only. In reality, the actual stresses would depend on various factors, including the user's input, material properties, and design configuration.
