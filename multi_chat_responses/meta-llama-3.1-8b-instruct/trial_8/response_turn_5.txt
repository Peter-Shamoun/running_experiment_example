**Device Name:** High-Performance Slingshot (HPS)

**Objective:** Maximize the force output of the HPS to achieve the highest possible range and accuracy.

**Design Overview:**

The HPS consists of a carbon fiber frame, a high-strength rubber elastic band, and a precision-crafted aluminum projectile. The device is designed to store energy in the elastic band, which is then released to propel the projectile.

**Materials:**

* **Carbon Fiber Frame:** 10mm x 10mm x 20mm (0.4" x 0.4" x 0.8") with a tensile strength of 4,000 MPa (580,000 psi)
* **High-Strength Rubber Elastic Band:** 2mm x 20mm x 150mm (0.08" x 0.8" x 5.9") with a tensile strength of 20 MPa (2,900 psi)
* **Aluminum Projectile:** 15mm x 5mm x 50mm (0.6" x 0.2" x 2") with a mass of 20 grams (0.7 oz)

**Measurements:**

* **Elastic Band Pre-Stretch:** 30% of the band's original length
* **Pivot Point Diameter:** 5mm (0.2")
* **Sight System Diameter:** 10mm (0.4")

**Rationale:**

* **Carbon Fiber Frame:** Provides high strength-to-weight ratio and precision-crafting capabilities.
* **High-Strength Rubber Elastic Band:** Offers high energy storage capacity and durability.
* **Aluminum Projectile:** Provides high mass and aerodynamic efficiency.

**Calculations:**

1. **Elastic Band Force:**
	* Elastic band force (F) = (elastic modulus x cross-sectional area x pre-stretch) / (band length)
	* F = (10 MPa x 2mm x 20mm) / (150mm) = 267 N (60 lbf)
2. **Carbon Fiber Frame Stress:**
	* Carbon fiber frame stress (σ) = (tensile strength x cross-sectional area) / (frame length)
	* σ = (4,000 MPa x 10mm x 10mm) / (20mm) = 2,000 MPa (290,000 psi)
3. **Projectile Acceleration:**
	* Projectile acceleration (a) = (elastic band force) / (projectile mass)
	* a = (267 N) / (0.02 kg) = 13,350 m/s² (1,430 g)

**Total Force Calculation:**

The total force generated by the HPS is the sum of the elastic band force and the projectile acceleration.

Total Force (F_total) = Elastic Band Force (F) + Projectile Acceleration (a)
F_total = 267 N + 13,350 m/s² x 0.02 kg
F_total = 267 N + 266.5 N
F_total = 533.5 N (120 lbf)

**Conclusion:**

The High-Performance Slingshot (HPS) design is optimized for maximum force output, achieving a total force of 533.5 N (120 lbf). This design combines high-strength materials, precision-crafted components, and optimized measurements to achieve the highest possible range and accuracy.
