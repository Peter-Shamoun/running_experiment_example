Let's flesh out the simple slingshot design with the following components:

**Frame:**

* **Material:** Carbon Fiber (CF) with a density of 1.8 g/cm³
* **Dimensions:**
	+ Y-shaped frame: 20 cm (7.9 in) wide, 10 cm (3.9 in) deep, and 30 cm (11.8 in) tall
	+ Handle: 5 cm (1.9 in) diameter, 20 cm (7.9 in) long
* **Engineering Rationale:** The CF frame provides a high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a compact and lightweight design. The Y-shaped frame distributes the stresses of the elastic potential energy, while the handle provides a secure grip for the user.

**Elastic Band:**

* **Material:** Rubber (e.g., natural rubber or synthetic rubber)
* **Properties:**
	+ Young's Modulus (E): 10 MPa (1.45 x 10^6 psi)
	+ Tensile Strength (σ): 20 MPa (2.9 x 10^6 psi)
	+ Elongation at Break (ε): 500%
* **Engineering Rationale:** The rubber elastic band stores elastic potential energy, which is released when the user lets go of the handle. The band's properties ensure a high energy storage capacity and a rapid release of energy.

**Projectile:**

* **Material:** Aluminum (e.g., 6061-T6)
* **Dimensions:** 2 cm (0.79 in) diameter, 5 cm (1.9 in) length
* **Mass:** 20 grams
* **Shape:** Spherical with a rounded nose for aerodynamic stability
* **Engineering Rationale:** The aluminum projectile provides a high strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a compact and lightweight design. The spherical shape minimizes air resistance, while the rounded nose reduces the risk of ricochets.

**Measurement Choices:**

* **Distance Measurement:** Laser rangefinder with an accuracy of ±1 cm (±0.39 in)
* **Velocity Measurement:** Doppler radar with an accuracy of ±1 m/s (±2.2 mph)

**Theoretical Optimization:**

To optimize the slingshot design for raw distance metrics, we can consider the following parameters:

1. **Elastic Band Length:** Increase the band length to store more elastic potential energy, but be mindful of the band's tensile strength and elongation at break.
2. **Frame Dimensions:** Optimize the frame dimensions to minimize weight while maintaining structural integrity.
3. **Projectile Mass:** Increase the projectile mass to achieve a higher kinetic energy, but be mindful of the projectile's aerodynamics and the risk of ricochets.
4. **Elastic Band Properties:** Optimize the elastic band's properties to achieve a higher energy storage capacity and a rapid release of energy.

By adjusting these parameters, we can theoretically optimize the simple slingshot design for raw distance metrics. However, please note that this is a simplified model and actual performance may vary depending on various factors, including user technique and environmental conditions.
