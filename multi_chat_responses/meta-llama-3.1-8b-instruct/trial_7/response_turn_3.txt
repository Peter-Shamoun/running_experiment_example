Let's explore how the design would differ for a simple slingshot system.

**Simple Slingshot Design:**

A simple slingshot consists of a Y-shaped frame, a pouch, and a handle. The user draws the pouch back, storing elastic potential energy, and then releases it, propelling the projectile forward.

**Key Design Considerations:**

1. **Frame Material**: A lightweight, yet strong material like **Carbon Fiber** or **Fiberglass** would be suitable for the frame, as it needs to withstand the stresses of the elastic potential energy.
2. **Pouch Material**: A durable, flexible material like **Nylon** or **Polyurethane** would be ideal for the pouch, as it needs to withstand the stresses of the elastic potential energy and the projectile's impact.
3. **Elastic Band**: A high-strength, elastic band like **Rubber** or **Elastic Cord** would be used to store the elastic potential energy.
4. **Handle Material**: A comfortable, durable material like **Wood** or **Plastic** would be used for the handle, as it needs to provide a secure grip for the user.

**Design Differences:**

Compared to the Aerius launcher, the simple slingshot design would have the following differences:

1. **Simplified Frame**: The Y-shaped frame would be much simpler in design, with fewer components and less complexity.
2. **Elastic Potential Energy**: The slingshot relies on elastic potential energy stored in the elastic band, whereas the Aerius launcher uses a flywheel to store rotational kinetic energy.
3. **Pouch and Projectile**: The slingshot has a pouch that holds the projectile, whereas the Aerius launcher has a smooth-bore barrel that accelerates the projectile.
4. **User Interaction**: The slingshot requires the user to manually draw back the pouch and release it, whereas the Aerius launcher uses a crank to store energy and a pneumatic system to launch the projectile.

**Presentation Tips:**

1. **Highlight the simplicity**: Emphasize the simplicity of the slingshot design and how it relies on elastic potential energy.
2. **Showcase the elastic band**: Demonstrate the elastic band's ability to store energy and release it quickly.
3. **Discuss the user interaction**: Explain how the user interacts with the slingshot, including the manual drawing and releasing of the pouch.

By comparing and contrasting the Aerius launcher and the simple slingshot, you can demonstrate your understanding of the design trade-offs and the importance of choosing the right design for a specific application.
