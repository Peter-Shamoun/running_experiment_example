Excellent and critical question. Moving from a theoretical simulation to considering real-world components highlights the immense safety implications of such a design.

Here is a clear breakdown of why this would be unsafe and how it relates to the safety cap.

### **Safety Analysis: TMFP with Real-World Projectiles**

**Short Answer:** Yes, this design would be **catastrophically unsafe** if rocks or standard steel balls were used. The entire system is predicated on a perfect, theoretical balance of components. Introducing imperfect variables would not just reduce performance; it would lead to a violent, unpredictable system failure.

### **Why It Would Be Unsafe**

The danger stems from two core engineering principles: **Material Integrity** and **Energy Transfer Mismatch**.

#### **1. Using Rocks (Failure of Material Integrity)**

A rock is not an engineered projectile. Using one in a system designed to impart **4050 Joules** of energy is a recipe for disaster.

*   **Projectile Disintegration:** The immense, instantaneous acceleration would likely cause the rock to **shatter inside the pouch upon release**. Instead of a single projectile, the TMFP would launch a high-velocity, shotgun-like blast of rock fragments in an unpredictable cone. This poses an extreme danger to the operator and the entire surrounding area.
*   **Inconsistent Aerodynamics:** A rock's irregular shape would cause it to tumble erratically in flight. It would be impossible to aim, and its final trajectory would be completely random, making it an uncontrolled hazard.
*   **Chaotic Release Mechanics:** An irregularly shaped rock will not sit perfectly centered in the pouch. This creates an imbalanced load on the band array, causing a chaotic, twisting release that could easily result in the bands striking the frame or the operator's hand.

#### **2. Using Steel Balls (Failure of Energy Transfer Mismatch)**

This is a more subtle but equally dangerous failure. The TMFP is a **finely-tuned system**. The 22.4g tungsten projectile is not just ammo; it is a critical component whose mass is required to properly absorb the immense energy from the power bands.

*   **The Inertia Problem:** A 14mm steel ball has a mass of only ~11.5 grams, roughly **half** the mass of the required tungsten projectile. It simply does not have enough inertia to properly draw the energy out of the massive band set.
*   **Resulting Backlash:** Because the projectile is too light, a massive amount of excess energy is left in the latex bands after the projectile has left the pouch. This energy doesn't vanish; it causes the bands to retract with **uncontrolled, violent hyper-velocity**.
*   **Catastrophic Failure Modes:**
    1.  **Hand/Frame Slap:** The bands will slam forward into the frame and the operator's forward-bracing hand with destructive force.
    2.  **System Shock:** The energy shockwave will travel back through the exoskeletal frame into the operator's body, posing a risk of injury.
    3.  **Band Destruction:** The bands themselves, unable to transfer their energy load, will likely shred or snap, turning into high-velocity whips that can cause severe harm. This is the equivalent of "dry-firing" a high-powered bow, which can cause it to delaminate and explode.

### **Would They Exceed the 60 Joule Safety Cap?**

**Yes, unequivocally.** The system's output is so colossal that even with massive inefficiencies, it would surpass the 60J limit by an enormous margin.

*   **System Potential Energy:** **4050 Joules**
*   **Safety Cap:** **60 Joules**

The TMFP is designed to store **67.5 times** the energy of the safety cap.

Let's analyze the inefficient steel ball scenario. Even if we assume a terrible energy transfer efficiency of only 20% (meaning 80% of the energy is wasted in the violent backlash described above), the projectile's kinetic energy would be:

*   **Kinetic Energy (KE) = Total Stored Energy * Efficiency**
*   `KE = 4050 J * 0.20`
*   **KE = 810 Joules**

Even in this highly inefficient, self-destructive state, the projectile would leave the launcher with **810 Joules** of energy, which is still **13.5 times** the 60 Joule safety cap.

**Conclusion for the Judges:** The TMFP's power is a direct result of its design as a holistic, tuned system. The projectile is not an interchangeable element but a load-bearing component. Substituting any non-specified projectile would render the system dangerously unstable and would still produce energy levels that are an order of magnitude beyond established safety thresholds.
