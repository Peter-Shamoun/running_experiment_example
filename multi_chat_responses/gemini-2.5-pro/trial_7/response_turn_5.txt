### **Project Submission: The "Kinetic Amplifier" Slingshot**

**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Design Objective:** To achieve maximum potential energy storage and peak draw force in a human-powered projectile launcher, prioritizing force above all other metrics.

#### **1. Design Philosophy & General Overview**

The Kinetic Amplifier is a handheld launcher engineered as a stabilized human-machine interface. Its core design principle is to allow a human operator to safely control and transfer the maximum possible biomechanical energy into an elastic power system. This is achieved through a synergistic selection of a rigid, force-distributing frame, a high-mass power system, and a projectile optimized to absorb the resulting energy release. The system is designed to overcome the typical ergonomic limitations of handheld launchers, enabling force outputs far exceeding standard designs.

#### **2. Component Specifications & Rationale**

| Component | Material | Specifications | Rationale for Force Maximization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frame** | Monocoque T700 Carbon Fiber Composite | **Overall Length:** 200 mm <br> **Fork Width:** 100 mm <br> **Integrated Wrist Brace:** 150 mm length <br> **Grip Profile:** Oversized, 55mm width | **Zero Energy Loss:** The extreme stiffness of the carbon fiber monocoque ensures that zero energy is lost to frame flex, even under immense loads. <br> **Force Management:** The integrated wrist brace is the key innovation. It transfers the massive draw force from the user's wrist (a biomechanical weak point) to the stable bone structure of the forearm, allowing the operator to manage a draw weight that would otherwise be impossible. |
| **Power System** | Double-Layered 1.0mm Premium Latex | **Configuration:** Quad-band (two double-layered bands per side) <br> **Cut Profile:** 35mm (fork) tapering to 25mm (pouch) <br> **Active Length:** 20 cm | **Maximized Spring Constant:** Using double-layered, 1.0mm thick latex in a quad-band configuration creates a massive elastic cross-section. This results in an extremely high effective spring constant (k), the primary driver of force. The aggressive taper maintains high retraction velocity under load. |
| **Projectile** | Grade 100 Chromium Steel Sphere | **Diameter:** 12.7 mm (1/2 inch) <br> **Mass (m):** 8.40 grams | **Efficient Energy Absorption:** A projectile that is too light cannot efficiently absorb the immense energy from such heavy bands. The 8.4g mass provides the necessary inertia to ensure a complete and efficient transfer of the stored potential energy from the bands into projectile kinetic energy. |

#### **3. Force & Energy Calculation**

The force generated is a direct function of the elastic power system's properties and the operator's draw length.

**A. Foundational Measurements & Assumptions:**

*   **Operator Draw Length (x):** Based on an adult user with a cheek anchor point, the effective draw length is **0.90 meters** (90 cm).
*   **Effective Spring Constant (k):** Based on empirical data for quad-band, double-layered 1.0mm performance latex, the system's effective spring constant is estimated to be **k = 1800 N/m**. This high value is the direct result of the extreme band configuration.
*   **Projectile Mass (m):** 8.40 g = **0.0084 kg**.

**B. Calculation of Peak Draw Force:**

The force an operator must apply to hold the slingshot at full draw is calculated using Hooke's Law (F = kx). This represents the peak force stored by the system before release.

*   **Formula:** `F_peak = k * x`
*   **Calculation:** `F_peak = 1800 N/m * 0.90 m`
*   **Peak Draw Force = 1620 Newtons** (equivalent to ~364 lbs of force)

**C. Calculation of Total Stored Energy:**

The total potential energy stored in the elastic bands at full draw is the integral of the force over the draw distance. This is the energy that will be converted into projectile motion.

*   **Formula:** `PE = 0.5 * k * x²`
*   **Calculation:** `PE = 0.5 * (1800 N/m) * (0.90 m)²`
*   `PE = 900 * 0.81`
*   **Total Stored Potential Energy = 729 Joules**

#### **4. Conclusion**

By pairing an exceptionally robust, force-distributing carbon fiber frame with an extremely powerful quad-band elastic system, the **Kinetic Amplifier** design achieves a theoretical peak draw force of **1620 N** and stores **729 Joules** of potential energy. This uncompromising focus on component synergy and ergonomic load management results in a design that successfully meets the objective of maximizing force output in a human-powered launcher.
