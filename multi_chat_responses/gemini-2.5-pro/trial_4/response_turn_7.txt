Excellent and critically important questions. The transition from theoretical simulation to practical application reveals the immense danger of such a design.

Here is a breakdown of the safety implications and a direct answer to your questions.

### **Safety Analysis: OBS-X with Real-World Projectiles**

Yes, using this design with standard rock or steel balls would be **profoundly and unacceptably unsafe.** The OBS-X is a theoretical "glass cannon," engineered to operate at the absolute peak of material and physical limits *under the assumption of perfect, idealized conditions.* Introducing imperfect, real-world components would lead to immediate and catastrophic failure.

Here is a point-by-point analysis:

#### **Why It Is Unsafe**

**1. The Problem with Rocks:**

*   **Asymmetrical Shape & Sharp Edges:** This is the primary point of failure. The pouch and bands are under **2,040 N (459 lbs) of tension** at full draw. A rock's sharp, irregular edge would act like a razor blade against the stressed latex and pouch fibers. It would not require a "draw" to cut it; the immense pressure alone would cause the material to shear instantly. This would result in an explosive, uncontrolled release of the 1,020 Joules of stored energy, likely sending band fragments and the projectile in unpredictable, dangerous directions.
*   **Inconsistent Mass:** The system is tuned for a 32-gram projectile. A lighter rock would not absorb the energy, causing the pouch and bands to fly forward and violently strike the frame and user's hand ("frame strike"). A heavier rock would increase the draw force beyond the material's already non-existent safety margin, guaranteeing failure.
*   **Unpredictable Aerodynamics:** A tumbling, irregular rock has no stable flight path. It is as likely to fly sideways or upwards as it is to fly forward, posing a massive risk to the operator and bystanders.

**2. The Problem with Standard Steel Balls:**

*   **Mass Mismatch & Energy Transfer Failure:** A 16mm steel ball weighs approximately 16.7g. This is roughly **half the mass** the system is designed to propel. When released, the hyper-elastic bands would contract far faster than the lightweight projectile can accelerate. This creates several critical hazards:
    *   **Extreme "Hand Shock":** The massive surplus of energy, unable to transfer into the projectile, would be reflected back into the frame and the user's arm as a violent, bone-jarring shockwave.
    *   **"Return to Sender" (RTS):** A common phenomenon in overpowered slingshots with light ammo. The pouch can travel forward, strike the user's hand holding the frame, and recoil backward—potentially launching the steel ball directly at the operator's face.
    *   **Catastrophic Band Failure:** The violent, snapping motion of the under-loaded bands would put immense stress on the attachment points, leading to rapid material fatigue and failure.

### **Kinetic Energy Calculation vs. 60 Joule Safety Cap**

**Yes, the projectile would exceed the 60 Joule safety cap by an enormous margin.**

Let's calculate the expected kinetic energy of the projectile at launch.

1.  **Stored Potential Energy (PE):** We calculated this to be **1,020 Joules**.
2.  **Energy Transfer Efficiency:** No system is 100% efficient. However, a highly optimized theoretical design like the OBS-X would have very high efficiency (minimal energy lost to band heat, air resistance on the bands, etc.). Let's assume a conservative **85% efficiency** for this calculation.
3.  **Kinetic Energy (KE) Transferred to Projectile:**
    *   KE = Stored Potential Energy × Efficiency
    *   KE = 1,020 J × 0.85
    *   **KE ≈ 867 Joules**

**Comparison to Safety Cap:**

*   **Calculated Kinetic Energy:** **867 J**
*   **Contest Safety Cap:** **60 J**

The OBS-X design would launch its projectile with a kinetic energy **over 14 times the stated safety limit.**

**Conclusion:** The OBS-X is a fascinating theoretical exercise in maximizing force within a simulation. However, if it were ever built, it would be an extremely dangerous device. The use of any projectile other than the perfectly matched, perfectly shaped tungsten sphere would almost certainly cause the system to self-destruct. Furthermore, the sheer energy output places it firmly in the category of a lethal weapon, far exceeding any reasonable safety standard for a design contest.
