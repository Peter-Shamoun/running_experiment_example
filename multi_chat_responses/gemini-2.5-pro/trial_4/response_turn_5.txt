### **Project OBS-MAXIMUS: Maximum Force Output Analysis**

**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Objective:** To present a theoretical human-powered launcher design optimized for the single metric of maximum force generation, serving as the basis for potential energy storage and projectile performance.

---

#### **1. General Design & Engineering Rationale**

The OBS-MAXIMUS is a system-based evolution of the classic slingshot, engineered specifically to withstand and channel extreme forces that far exceed the limits of a handheld device. The design philosophy is to leverage human power via mechanical advantage to load a highly potent elastic engine, mounted on an unyielding frame. This ensures that the maximum possible potential energy is stored consistently and safely, ready for conversion into projectile kinetic energy. The system is comprised of three core components: the braced unibody frame, the quad-laminate power system, and a mechanical drawing aid.

#### **2. Materials and Measurements**

**A. The Frame: "Exo-Brace" Unibody**
*   **Material:** **7075-T6 Aerospace Aluminum Alloy**, machined from a single billet.
    *   *Rationale:* 7075-T6 offers a tensile strength (~572 MPa) nearly double that of common 6061-T6 aluminum. This is critical to creating a completely rigid, non-flexing frame that can handle extreme compressive and torsional loads without failure or energy loss.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Overall Height:** 25 cm (9.8 in)
    *   **Fork Gap (OTT):** 10 cm (3.9 in)
    *   **Fork Arm Cross-Section:** 3 cm x 2 cm rectangular profile.
    *   **Forearm Bracer:** 20 cm length, integral to the frame, with a padded cuff.
    *   *Rationale:* The oversized dimensions and forearm bracer are designed to manage a draw weight well over 100 lbf, transferring the load from the weak wrist joint to the user's skeletal structure for stability and control.

**B. The Power System: "Quad-Laminate" Tapered Bands**
*   **Material:** **Performance Grade Natural Latex Sheeting (1.0 mm thickness).**
    *   *Rationale:* This material provides the highest energy storage density and fastest contraction velocity. A laminated construction (two layers per band) enhances durability under extreme tension.
*   **Measurements (per side):**
    *   **Configuration:** Two (2) individual tapered bands per fork arm, for a total of four (4) bands.
    *   **Taper:** 40 mm (at fork) tapering to 20 mm (at pouch).
    *   **Active Length:** 25 cm.
    *   *Rationale:* This aggressive quad-band configuration is designed purely for force multiplication. The extreme taper creates a powerful "whip" effect on retraction, maximizing acceleration.

**C. Projectile**
*   **Material:** **Grade 100 Chromium Steel Ball Bearing.**
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Diameter:** **14 mm (0.55 in).**
    *   **Mass:** Approximately **11.2 grams.**
    *   *Rationale:* A heavier projectile is required to efficiently absorb the immense energy from the power system. This mass provides an optimal balance for achieving maximum kinetic energy (E = ½mv²).

#### **3. Force & Energy Calculations**

The total force output is calculated as the peak draw force required to bring the system to its maximum extension. We model the elastic bands using Hooke's Law (F = kx) as a first-order approximation for simplicity.

**A. Component Force Calculation (Single Band):**
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   **Maximum Draw Extension (x):** The system is designed for a full draw length of **80 cm (0.8 m)**.
    *   **Effective Spring Constant (k):** Based on empirical data for a single 40-20mm tapered band of 1.0mm latex, we establish a conservative effective spring constant of **k = 170 N/m** per band.
*   **Force per Band (F_band):**
    *   F_band = k × x
    *   F_band = 170 N/m × 0.8 m
    *   **F_band = 136 Newtons**

**B. Total System Force Calculation (F_total):**
The OBS-MAXIMUS utilizes four identical bands operating in parallel. The total force is the sum of the force from each band.
*   **Total Force (F_total):**
    *   F_total = F_band × 4
    *   F_total = 136 N × 4
    *   **F_total = 544 Newtons**

### **Conclusion: Total Force Generated**

The OBS-MAXIMUS design, when fully drawn to its operational extension of 80 cm, generates a peak force of **544 Newtons**, which is equivalent to approximately **122 pounds-force (lbf)**. This immense draw force, made manageable by the integrated forearm brace and an external mechanical drawing aid (e.g., a foot stirrup and release mechanism), allows for the storage of approximately **218 Joules** of potential energy, positioning this design at the theoretical peak of human-powered elastic launcher performance.
