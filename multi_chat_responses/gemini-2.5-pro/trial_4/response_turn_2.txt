USER PROMPT:
Excellent framework! I need complete numerical specifications for a high-performance build. Please provide: 1) Frame: exact dimensions (arm length, tube OD/wall thickness), material (6061 aluminum), estimated weight, 2) Elastic system: specific band type/size (latex tubing diameter, length, number of strands), draw length, band attachment method, 3) Projectile: exact mass in grams, diameter, material, shape, 4) Pouch: material and dimensions, 5) Expected stored energy in Joules and predicted KE output, 6) Human energy input required. I need every specification to build and test this design.

============================================================

MODEL RESPONSE:
Of course. Here are the complete numerical specifications for a high-performance, competition-grade elastic launcher. This design is ambitious, powerful, and prioritizes performance, but is buildable with standard tools and materials.

**Design Philosophy:** This is a "heavy-class" launcher designed for maximum energy output. The peak draw force is significant and will require a mechanical cocking aid (e.g., a small winch or a block-and-tackle system), which is common in top-tier competitions.

### 1. Frame Specifications

*   **Material:** 6061-T6 Aluminum, Square Tubing
*   **Tubing Cross-Section:** 1.5 inch x 1.5 inch (or metric equivalent, 40mm x 40mm)
*   **Tubing Wall Thickness:** 1/8 inch (or metric equivalent, 3mm)
*   **Overall Length:** 1.5 meters (59 inches)
*   **Overall Width (at front forks):** 0.5 meters (19.7 inches)
*   **Overall Height:** 0.4 meters (15.7 inches)
*   **Geometry:** "Y-Frame" Truss design.
    *   **Main Rail:** A single 1.5m length of tubing forms the projectile guide and primary structure.
    *   **Forward Forks:** Two arms extend from the main rail to the band anchor points. The base of the "Y" connects to the main rail 0.4m from the front end.
    *   **Support Structure:** A base made of the same tubing forms a stable platform, using triangular gussets for all 90-degree joints for maximum rigidity.
*   **Joints:** If possible, TIG welded. If bolting, use 3/8" or M10 Grade 8 bolts with large reinforcing gusset plates at every joint.
*   **Estimated Frame Weight:** Approximately **9.5 kg (21 lbs)**.




### 2. Elastic System Specifications

*   **Band Type:** Primeline Industries Speargun Rubber Tubing, 16mm (5/8") Outer Diameter with 3mm (1/8") inner hole.
*   **Number of Strands:** **6 total** (3 continuous loops, meaning 3 bands per side of the pouch).
*   **Resting Band Length (rubber only):** **400mm (15.75 inches)** per strand.
*   **Draw Length:** **1.0 meter (39.4 inches)** from resting position to full draw.
*   **Stretch Factor:** 3.5x (or 350%). This is calculated as (Resting Length + Draw Length) / Resting Length = (400mm + 1000mm) / 400mm = 3.5.
*   **Band Attachment Method (Frame):** The bands will be looped around two polished **12mm diameter stainless steel rods** serving as anchors at the front forks. This prevents abrasion.
*   **Band Attachment Method (Pouch):** Use a **Dyneema/Spectra cord wishbone** inserted into the rubber tubing and secured with a constrictor knot. This is the standard high-strength, low-weight method.

### 3. Projectile Specifications

*   **Mass:** **300 grams (10.6 oz)**. *This is a critical starting point for tuning. You should also build 250g and 350g versions for testing.*
*   **Material:** **4140 Steel**. It is dense, strong, and readily machinable.
*   **Shape:** **Ogive-nosed cylinder with fins (Finned Dart)**.
    *   **Overall Length:** 80mm
    *   **Body Diameter:** 25mm
    *   **Nose Shape:** Tangent ogive with a length of 35mm.
    *   **Fins:** 3 or 4 fins at the tail, made from 1.5mm sheet aluminum, secured in milled slots.
*   **Stability:** The Center of Mass will be naturally well forward of the Center of Pressure due to the heavy steel body and light tail fins, ensuring stable flight.

### 4. Pouch / Sabot Specifications

*   **Purpose:** To provide a consistent, low-friction interface between the projectile and the bands, and to guide the projectile along the rail.
*   **Material:** **UHMW-PE (Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene)**. It is extremely durable, self-lubricating, and lightweight.
*   **Design:** A "cup" or "sabot" design.
    *   **Outer Diameter:** 38mm (to fit smoothly within the 40mm tube frame rail).
    *   **Inner Diameter:** 25.5mm (to cradle the projectile base).
    *   **Depth:** 20mm.
    *   **Attachment Points:** Drilled holes for the Dyneema wishbones.
*   **Estimated Mass:** Less than **30 grams**.

### 5. Performance Predictions

*   **Peak Draw Force (Human Energy Input):** At 1.0m draw, this band configuration will require approximately **1200 Newtons (270 lbf or 122 kgf)** of force.
*   **Stored Elastic Potential Energy:** The energy stored is the integral of the force-draw curve. Using a linear approximation for simplicity ($PE = 0.5 \times F_{max} \times x$):
    *   $PE_{stored} = 0.5 \times 1200 N \times 1.0 m = \textbf{600 Joules}$.
    *   (The actual value will be slightly higher as rubber's force curve is progressive, but this is an excellent engineering estimate).
*   **Predicted Kinetic Energy Output:** Assuming a high-quality build with low friction and a well-matched projectile mass, a transfer efficiency ($\eta_{transfer}$) of 75% is achievable.
    *   $KE_{output} = PE_{stored} \times \eta_{transfer} = 600 J \times 0.75 = \textbf{450 Joules}$.
*   **Predicted Muzzle Velocity:** Using the 300g projectile:
    *   $v = \sqrt{(2 \times KE) / m} = \sqrt{(2 \times 450 J) / 0.3 kg} = \sqrt{3000}$
    *   $v \approx \textbf{54.8 m/s (180 ft/s or 123 mph)}$.

### **Building and Testing Recommendations**

1.  **Safety First:** This is not a toy. At 450J, this device has energy comparable to a powerful air rifle or a small-caliber firearm. Never dry-fire it. Always have a secure backstop. Wear safety glasses during operation.
2.  **Cocking Mechanism:** Do not attempt to draw this by hand. Build a simple cocking mechanism using a geared hand winch (boat trailer winch) and Dyneema rope.
3.  **Trigger Mechanism:** A robust trigger is essential. A simple pin-release mechanism that can withstand over 1200N of force is required.
4.  **Tuning:** The 300g projectile is a calculated starting point. The single most important part of the competition will be to **test projectiles of different masses** (e.g., 250g, 275g, 300g, 325g, 350g) and measure their exit velocity with a chronograph. Calculate the KE for each and plot the results. The peak of that graph will be your optimal projectile mass for maximum score.
