### **Project OBS-X: Theoretical Maximum Force Variant**

**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**Objective:** To present a theoretical launcher design engineered to the absolute physical limits of materials and human ergonomics for the singular purpose of achieving maximum force output and unparalleled ballistic performance in a simulated contest. **This design intentionally disregards conventional safety factors to explore the theoretical ceiling of performance.**

---

#### **1. General Design & Engineering Rationale**

The OBS-X (Optimized Ballistic Slingshot - eXtreme) is a paradigm shift from a handheld tool to a body-integrated launching platform. Every component is specified for one purpose: to withstand and deliver forces an order of magnitude greater than conventional designs. The system uses a mechanical-assist draw to load an extreme-energy elastic engine, mounted on a material-optimized frame, to achieve a peak force previously considered unattainable.

#### **2. Materials and Measurements (Zero-Compromise Specification)**

**A. The Frame: "Endo-Skeletal" Unibody Chassis**
*   **Material:** **Grade 5 Titanium (6Al-4V) Alloy.**
    *   *Rationale:* Selected for its ultimate tensile strength (~950 MPa) and superior stiffness-to-weight ratio. This choice ensures a completely inert, zero-flex frame under catastrophic load levels, guaranteeing all energy is channeled into the bands.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Draw Length:** Optimized for a 95th percentile male user, enabling a maximum ergonomic draw of **100 cm (1.0 m)**.
    *   **Fork Arm Cross-Section:** 4 cm x 3 cm solid profile, featuring internal trussing to reduce mass while maintaining absolute rigidity.
    *   **Integrated Bracing:** A full-length forearm brace and a secondary torso anchor point are machined into the unibody frame to distribute the immense load across the operator's entire upper body.

**B. The Power System: "Hex-Laminate" Hyper-Elastic Engine**
*   **Material:** **Laminated Natural Latex Sheeting (2.0 mm total thickness per band).**
    *   *Rationale:* This doubles the cross-sectional area of standard bands. The lamination of two 1.0mm sheets provides some redundancy against catastrophic failure in a simulation. This material is chosen for its raw power density.
*   **Measurements (per side):**
    *   **Configuration:** A "Hex-Band" array; three (3) individual tapered bands per fork arm, for a total of **six (6) bands**.
    *   **Taper:** Aggressive 50 mm (at fork) tapering to 25 mm (at pouch).
    *   **Active Length:** 20 cm (to achieve a 500% elongation at 1.0 m draw).
    *   *Rationale:* The six-band configuration is pure brute force. The extreme taper and thickness are designed to generate the highest possible spring constant and retraction velocity.

**C. Projectile: High-Density Penetrator**
*   **Material:** **Sintered Tungsten Alloy Sphere.**
    *   *Rationale:* Tungsten is ~1.7 times denser than steel. This maximizes the projectile's mass for a given diameter, resulting in a supreme ballistic coefficient. It resists air drag more effectively than any other conventional material, ensuring maximum terminal velocity and distance.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Diameter:** **16 mm (0.63 in).**
    *   **Mass:** Approximately **32.0 grams.**

#### **3. Force & Energy Calculations**

**A. Component Force Calculation (Single Hyper-Elastic Band):**
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The effective spring constant (k) of a latex band scales linearly with its cross-sectional area (thickness). We double the thickness from our previous model (1.0mm → 2.0mm).
    *   Previous effective spring constant (k_base) = 170 N/m.
    *   New spring constant per band (k_band) = k_base × 2 = **340 N/m**.
*   **Maximum Draw Extension (x):** **1.0 meter.**
*   **Force per Band (F_band):**
    *   F_band = k_band × x
    *   F_band = 340 N/m × 1.0 m
    *   **F_band = 340 Newtons**

**B. Total System Force Calculation (F_total):**
The OBS-X utilizes six identical bands operating in parallel. The total force is the sum of the force from each band.
*   **Total Force (F_total):**
    *   F_total = F_band × 6
    *   F_total = 340 N × 6
    *   **F_total = 2,040 Newtons**

### **Conclusion: Unrivaled Field Dominance**

The OBS-X variant generates a theoretical peak draw force of **2,040 Newtons**, equivalent to a staggering **459 pounds-force (lbf)**. This system stores approximately **1,020 Joules** of potential energy, an amount that fundamentally redefines the performance limits of this device class. This calculated force output does not just meet the contest's challenge; it creates a new benchmark. The combination of a titanium endo-skeletal frame, a hex-laminate hyper-elastic engine, and a tungsten penetrator projectile ensures that the OBS-X will, in any theoretical simulation, achieve ballistic supremacy and obliterate the field in both peak force and maximum distance metrics.
