Excellent. Let's break down the structural frame for the Kinetic Recapture Trebuchet (KRT-1) with the specific focus on theoretical justification for your contest presentation.

### **Frame Ergonomics and Scaled Dimensions**

For a theoretical design, the primary ergonomic consideration is the **human power input interface**, which is the hand-cranked winch. The overall machine size is dictated by physics, but the point of human interaction should be optimized for an average adult user (5'10" or approx. 178 cm).

*   **Winch Placement Height:** The axle of the hand crank should be positioned at a comfortable height for generating sustained power. For a 5'10" user, this is approximately **42-45 inches (107-114 cm)** from the ground. This places the crank between waist and elbow height, allowing the operator to use both their arms and core for efficient power transmission without stooping or over-reaching.
*   **Crank Arm Radius:** A radius of **14 inches (35 cm)** is a good starting point. This provides significant mechanical advantage (torque) without requiring an uncomfortably large circular motion from the operator.
*   **Physics-Driven Frame Dimensions:** The frame's overall size is a function of the desired launch energy. A taller structure allows for a greater potential energy drop for the counterweight (PE = mgh).
    *   **Main Axle Height:** An axle height of **8 feet (2.44 m)** provides a substantial drop for the counterweight while remaining a manageable size.
    *   **Base Footprint:** Stability is paramount. An A-frame design with a wide base is essential to counteract the violent swinging motion. A base of **6 feet wide by 8 feet long (1.83 m x 2.44 m)**, with the longer dimension aligned with the direction of throw, creates a highly stable platform. This wide stance prevents the frame from rocking or tipping, which is critical for precision.

### **Suggested Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Structural Tubing**

For a design emphasizing theoretical optimization and performance metrics, 6061-T6 Aluminum is an ideal choice over steel or wood.

**Key Properties:**

*   **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** 6061-T6 has excellent tensile strength for its low density. This allows for a frame that is both strong and relatively lightweight.
*   **High Stiffness (Young's Modulus):** Aluminum is very stiff, meaning it resists bending and flexing under load. A rigid frame is absolutely essential for repeatability, as any flex would alter the launch geometry from shot to shot.
*   **Corrosion Resistance:** Excellent for an indoor/outdoor test environment.
*   **Predictability:** As a standardized engineering material, its properties (yield strength, elasticity, etc.) are well-documented, making it perfect for theoretical calculations and simulations (like Finite Element Analysis).

### **Engineering Rationale & Stress Considerations**

**Design Rationale:**

The proposed frame is a **triangulated A-frame structure**. Triangles are the most rigid simple geometric shape, making them ideal for handling the complex forces of a trebuchet. This design efficiently translates the dynamic loads from the swinging arm and counterweight down into the ground. Cross-bracing would be used along the base and between the A-frames to resist torsional (twisting) forces, further enhancing stability and precision.

**Basic Stress Considerations (for Presentation):**

The frame must withstand two primary load cases: static and dynamic.

1.  **Static Load:** This is the constant force of gravity from the fully raised counterweight acting on the main axle supports. This is a simple compressive load down the legs of the A-frame. While significant, it is the *lesser* of the two concerns.

2.  **Dynamic Load:** This is the critical case. The most extreme stress occurs at the bottom of the counterweight's swing, just after the projectile has been released. At this point, the centripetal force from the swinging mass adds to the force of gravity, creating a massive, high-impulse shock load on the main axle and its supports.

**For your judging presentation, you would state:**

"Our choice of a triangulated 6061-T6 aluminum frame is deliberate. Aluminum's high stiffness-to-weight ratio minimizes frame deformation, which is critical for shot-to-shot consistency.

Our primary stress analysis focuses on the **peak dynamic load** experienced by the main axle housing. We would perform a basic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to model this scenario. The simulation would verify that the **von Mises stress**—a measure of combined stresses—at critical points like the axle-support welds and the mid-span of the A-frame legs remains safely below the material's yield strength of ~240 MPa. By designing for a **safety factor of 3.0** against this peak dynamic load, we ensure the frame operates purely in the elastic region, guaranteeing zero plastic deformation and maximizing the repeatability that is central to our design philosophy."
