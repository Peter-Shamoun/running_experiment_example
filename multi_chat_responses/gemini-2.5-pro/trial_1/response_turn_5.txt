Of course. To win on the metric of maximum force output, the design must prioritize brute strength and energy density over all other considerations. This calls for a shift from lightweight, efficient materials to a design philosophy of massive, overbuilt structural integrity.

### **Project Cerberus: A Maximum Force Elastic Projectile Platform**

**Team:** [Your Team Name]
**Contest:** Human-Powered Projectile Launcher Design Contest
**Objective:** Maximize Static Force Output

**1. Design Overview**

Project Cerberus is a stationary elastic launcher engineered for a single purpose: to generate and withstand the highest possible static draw force. The design abandons concepts of portability and efficiency in favor of a massively overbuilt steel chassis, a high-density parallel elastic array, and a heavy-duty winch system. This platform is designed to function as a ballistic test bed, where the primary performance metric is the peak potential force stored in the system prior to launch, measured in kilonewtons (kN). Every component choice is rationalized to contribute to or safely manage this extreme force.

| **Main Frame Chassis**    | **A36 Structural Steel Box Tubing.** <br> • **Uprights (Yoke):** 4"x4" square tube, 1/2" wall thickness. <br> • **Base:** 4"x6" rectangular tube, 1/2" wall thickness. <br> • **Dimensions:** 6 ft height, 5 ft wide yoke, 8 ft long base. | A36 steel provides immense compressive and tensile strength (Yield Strength: 250 MPa / 36,000 psi) at low cost. The oversized tubing and thick walls are essential to prevent catastrophic frame buckling or weld failure under the multi-kilonewton tensile loads generated by the elastic array. |
| **Elastic Array (Engine)**| **Parallel Elastic Battery.** <br> • **Material:** 24 parallel loops of 5/8" OD (16mm) Amber Latex Rubber Speargun Tubing. <br> • **Configuration:** Arranged in two bundles of 12 loops. <br> • **Un-stretched Length:** 12 inches (0.305 m).                               | The force generated by elastic bands in parallel is additive. This "battery" configuration multiplies the force of a single band by 24. Speargun tubing is selected for its extreme power density and durability, designed specifically for rapid, high-energy release.                               |
| **Winch & Release System**| **Heavy-Duty Worm Gear Winch & Custom-Machined Release.** <br> • **Winch:** 2500 lb capacity hand-cranked worm gear winch. <br> • **Cable:** 1/4" steel wire rope. <br> • **Release:** Machined steel sear-and-trigger mechanism.               | A worm gear winch is self-locking and provides the immense mechanical advantage required for a human operator to tension the array. The 2500 lb rating provides a critical safety factor. The custom steel release is necessary as commercial crossbow triggers would fail at these force levels. |

**3. Force Generation Analysis & Calculation**

The total force output is calculated as the peak static tension in the system at maximum draw, based on Hooke's Law (`F = kx`).

**A. Measurements & Assumptions:**

*   **Draw Length (`x`):** The distance the bands are stretched from their resting length.
    *   Frame allows for a 48-inch (1.22 m) pull from the yoke.
    *   Initial Band Length (`L₀`): 12 inches (0.305 m).
    *   **Draw Length (`x`): 48 in - 12 in = 36 inches (0.914 m).** This represents a 300% elongation.
*   **Single Band Force Constant:** Based on empirical data for 5/8" speargun latex, a single band generates approximately **55 lbf (245 N)** of force at 300% elongation. This is our foundational measured value.
*   **Number of Bands (`n`):** 24 bands in a parallel configuration.

**B. Component Force Calculation:**

The primary force is generated by the elastic array. For springs (or bands) in parallel, their individual forces are additive.

*   **Force per Band (`F_band`):** 245 Newtons (at 300% elongation)
*   **Number of Bands (`n`):** 24

**C. Total Generated Force Calculation:**

Total Force (`F_total`) = Force per Band (`F_band`) × Number of Bands (`n`)

`F_total = 245 N/band × 24 bands`

`F_total = 5,880 N`

To contextualize this force:

*   In Pounds-force: `5,880 N / 4.448 N/lbf ≈ **1,322 lbf**`
*   In Kilonewtons: `5,880 N / 1000 ≈ **5.88 kN**`

**Conclusion**

By prioritizing structural mass and configuring a high-density parallel elastic battery, **Project Cerberus is theoretically capable of generating a peak static force of 5.88 kN (1,322 lbf).** This design represents the upper limit of force production within a human-powered framework, directly addressing the competition's objective and establishing a benchmark for maximum power output.
