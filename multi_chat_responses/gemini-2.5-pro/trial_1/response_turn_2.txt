Excellent question. A well-justified structural design is critical for a strong theoretical presentation. Here is a breakdown of the main frame recommendations for the Kinetic Recapture Trebuchet (KRT), tailored for your contest submission.

---

### **Ergonomic Scaling and Dimensions**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an operator who is 5'10" (approx. 178 cm), the design prioritizes safe and efficient operation of the human-powered systems.

*   **Overall Height:** **7 feet (approx. 2.1 meters).** This provides ample clearance for the operator to stand comfortably within the frame's footprint without risk of interfering with the swing arm. It also allows for a significant counterweight drop, which is crucial for generating power.
*   **Base Footprint:** **6 ft wide x 8 ft long (approx. 1.8m x 2.4m).** The A-frame structure should be wider than it is tall to create a low center of gravity and ensure stability. The longer dimension is oriented in the direction of the launch to counteract the powerful forward-and-back rocking motion during the launch and recapture phases.
*   **Ergonomic Interface (Winch Handle):** The central point of human interaction is loading the counterweight. A hand-cranked winch should be positioned at **42 inches (approx. 107 cm) from the ground.** This is an ideal height for an average adult, falling between the waist and chest, allowing them to use their body weight and core muscles effectively and reducing back strain.

### **Suggested Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

For a theoretical contest submission, **6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy** is a superior choice over steel or wood. It offers an optimal balance of properties that align perfectly with the contest's focus on efficiency and optimization. The recommended form factor would be **3"x3" square tubing with a 1/4" wall thickness** for the main A-frame supports.

**Key Material Properties:**

| Property                  | Value (Approximate)         | Significance for KRT Design                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Yield Strength**        | 276 MPa (40,000 psi)        | The stress at which the frame will start to permanently deform.  |
| **Ultimate Tensile Strength** | 310 MPa (45,000 psi)        | The maximum stress the material can withstand before fracturing. |
| **Young's Modulus**         | 69 GPa (10,000 ksi)         | A measure of stiffness. High stiffness minimizes frame flex.    |
| **Density**                 | 2.70 g/cm³                  | Low density provides a high strength-to-weight ratio.          |

### **Engineering Rationale & Stress Considerations**

The choice of 6061-T6 aluminum and the A-frame geometry is a deliberate engineering decision to manage specific, predictable stresses while optimizing for contest metrics.

**1. Primary Load Case: Dynamic Launch Forces**
The most extreme forces on the frame do not occur when the machine is static, but during the violent acceleration of the launch.

*   **Bending Moment in the Uprights:** The two main A-frame supports holding the main axle act as cantilever beams. The swinging counterweight creates a massive, dynamic bending moment that is greatest at the base of the frame. The wide 6-foot stance and square tubing geometry are designed to resist this moment and prevent the frame from buckling. For your presentation, you can state that the design must ensure that the maximum bending stress (`σ = My/I`) remains well below the material's yield strength, incorporating a **Factor of Safety of 3.0** to account for dynamic loading.

*   **Torsional Stress on the Frame:** As the arm swings, slight imbalances will create a twisting force (torsion) across the frame. Square tubing is vastly superior to I-beams or C-channels in resisting torsion, ensuring the frame remains rigid. This rigidity is essential for the **repeatability** metric, as frame twist would introduce a variable that affects the launch angle.

**2. Critical Stress Point: The Recapture Event**
The innovative feature of the KRT also introduces a unique stress point.

*   **Impact Load at the Piston Mount:** When the counterweight arm completes its swing and engages the kinetic-to-pneumatic converter, it creates a sudden, high-impact shock load. This force is transferred through the piston's mounting point into the frame. Our design specifies that this mount must be located on a reinforced cross-member connecting the two A-frames. This distributes the shock across the entire structure rather than concentrating it on a single point, preventing localized material fatigue and failure.

**3. Energy Efficiency Rationale:**
The high strength-to-weight ratio of 6061-T6 aluminum is not just for structural integrity; it's an efficiency play. A lighter frame means that more of the human operator's energy goes into lifting the counterweight (storing potential energy) rather than being "wasted" in the form of a needlessly heavy structure. In your theoretical analysis, you can quantify this by calculating the total potential energy of the system (`U = mgh`) and showing that a lower frame mass (`m_frame`) allows for a higher counterweight mass (`m_cw`) for the same total human energy input, directly leading to a higher launch velocity.
