Absolutely. This is a critical question and highlights the immense gap between a theoretical simulation and real-world application.

Here is an analysis of why this design would be lethally unsafe with improper ammunition and a direct calculation regarding the 60J safety cap.

### **Safety Analysis: Project OVERLORD with Improvised Ammunition**

**Short Answer:** Yes, using a rock or a standard steel ball in the Project OVERLORD design would be **catastrophically unsafe**. The design is a "glass cannon" engineered for a single, perfect-use case in a simulation. Deviating from that use case introduces multiple, immediate points of failure.

### **Why It Would Be Unsafe**

The danger arises from two core principles: **Inconsistency (Rocks)** and **Mass Mismatch (Steel Balls)**.

#### **1. Using a Rock (The Unpredictable Variable)**

A rock introduces catastrophic unpredictability into a system demanding absolute consistency.

*   **Asymmetrical Release:** A rock's irregular shape will not self-center in the pouch. Upon release, it will tumble chaotically instead of flying straight. This guarantees an unstable launch.
*   **Pouch and Band Damage:** A rock's sharp edges and abrasive surface create extreme stress points on the pouch and latex bands during the 1,334 N (300 lbf) draw. This could easily cause the pouch to rip or a band to snap mid-draw, which would be incredibly violent and send the remaining band assembly flying back at the operator.
*   **Guaranteed "Return to Sender" (RTS):** The unstable release means the pouch will not fly forward cleanly. It is almost certain to recoil erratically, potentially striking the user's hand, arm, or face with tremendous force.

#### **2. Using a Steel Ball (The Mismatched System)**

While a steel ball is consistent in shape, it introduces a critical **mass mismatch** that destabilizes the entire energy transfer process.

*   **Mass Calculation:**
    *   Designed Projectile (15mm Tungsten Carbide): **~25.9 grams**
    *   Improvised Projectile (15mm Steel): **~13.9 grams**
    *   **Result:** The steel ball is only **54%** of the mass the power system was designed for.

*   **Inefficient Energy Transfer & "Pouch Slap":** The ultra-powerful, heavy bands are tuned to accelerate a 25.9g mass. When launching a much lighter 13.9g ball, the bands contract faster than the projectile can be pushed. This causes the pouch to "overrun" the projectile, creating a violent slap.
*   **Extreme Risk of a Fork Hit:** The unstable energy transfer from the overrun greatly increases the chance of the projectile being released erratically and striking the frame. A "fork hit" from a system storing **840 Joules** would be explosive. It would not just damage the frame; it would likely cause the forged titanium to shatter, sending high-velocity shrapnel back at the operator.

### **Calculation: The 60 Joule (60 J) Safety Cap**

Your final question gets to the heart of the power disparity.

*   **Competition Safety Cap:** 60 Joules (60 J)
*   **Project OVERLORD Calculated Stored Energy:** **840.4 Joules (840.4 J)**

To compare:

**840.4 J / 60 J = 14.0**

**Conclusion:** The Project OVERLORD design does not merely exceed the safety cap; it surpasses it by a factor of **14 times**.

To put this into real-world context:
*   A typical high-power air rifle for hunting small game is around 30-40 J.
*   A .22LR rimfire bullet, fired from a pistol, has a muzzle energy of about 160-190 J.

The theoretical energy stored in Project OVERLORD is over **4 times more powerful than a .22 caliber bullet**. It is an extremely lethal amount of energy, and any instability in its release—caused by using improper ammunition like rocks or mismatched steel balls—would create a life-threatening failure. This is why such designs must remain purely theoretical exercises for simulation and optimization contests.
