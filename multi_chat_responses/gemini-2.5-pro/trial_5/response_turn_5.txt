### **Technical Submission: PMSS-FO (Precision Marksman Slingshot - Force Optimized)**

**Team:** [Your Team Name Here]
**Contest:** Human-Powered Projectile Launcher Design Contest
**Date:** [Date]

#### **1. Design Overview**

The PMSS-FO is a human-integrated firing platform engineered for a singular purpose: to maximize the potential energy stored in an elastic system and convert it into projectile force with unparalleled efficiency. The design philosophy treats the human operator not as a source of inconsistency, but as a stable power-plant. By using a rigid, shoulder-stocked frame, the immense draw forces are braced against the user's core body mass, allowing for energy storage levels far exceeding traditional handheld designs. Every component is selected to withstand extreme loads and contribute to a "zero-deflection" system, ensuring all stored energy is channeled directly into the projectile.

#### **2. Component Specifications & Rationale**

| Component | Material Specification | Key Measurements | Engineering Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Frame** | Monolithic, unidirectional T700 Carbon Fiber with 7075-T6 Aluminum hardpoints. | **Overall Length:** 90 cm<br>**Draw-Bracing Foregrip:** 45 cm from shoulder butt<br>**Fork Height:** 6 cm (low-profile) | **Extreme Rigidity:** The frame is designed as a static jig. The high-modulus carbon fiber layup resists all bending and torsional forces, preventing energy loss through frame flex. The foregrip allows the operator to use a "push-pull" technique, bracing the immense load against their body. |
| **Elastic Power System** | Competition-Grade Quad-Layered Natural Latex Sheeting (0.8mm per layer). | **Configuration:** Four bonded layers per side.<br>**Cut:** 40mm (fork) to 25mm (pouch) taper.<br>**Active Length:** 20 cm.<br>**Target Draw Length:** 120 cm (6:1 stretch ratio). | **Maximum Energy Density:** A quad-layered, tapered band configuration provides a massive cross-sectional area for force generation. The 6:1 stretch ratio pushes the latex to its maximum safe energy storage limit, resulting in an exponential force-draw curve. |
| **Projectile** | Sintered Tungsten Alloy (97% W, Ni, Fe). | **Shape:** Aerodynamic Spindle/Dart.<br>**Mass:** **30.0 grams** (precisely machined).<br>**Dimensions:** 10mm max diameter, 32mm length. | **Inertial Energy Transfer & Density:** Tungsten's extreme density provides a high-mass projectile in a small, low-drag profile. This high inertia is critical for efficiently absorbing the explosive energy release from the powerful bands. |

#### **3. Force & Energy Calculations**

The total force generated by the design is defined as the peak static force exerted by the elastic system on the projectile at maximum draw.

**Assumptions:**
*   The force-draw curve of the multi-layered latex is approximated as a linear spring for calculation clarity (`F = kx`).
*   The operator is capable of achieving the target draw force through the braced, ergonomic frame.
*   `x` = Draw Extension = (Draw Length - Active Length) = 1.20 m - 0.20 m = **1.0 meter**.

**Step 1: Determine the System's Spring Constant (k)**
Based on empirical data for this band configuration, the target peak draw weight is **50 kgf** (kilogram-force), representing the upper limit for a braced adult operator.
*   Peak Force (`F_peak`) = 50 kgf * 9.81 m/s² = **490.5 Newtons**.
*   Using Hooke’s Law (`F = kx`):
    `k = F_peak / x`
    `k = 490.5 N / 1.0 m`
    `k = 490.5 N/m`

**Step 2: Calculate Stored Elastic Potential Energy (PE)**
This represents the total energy available for transfer to the projectile.
*   `PE = 0.5 * k * x²`
*   `PE = 0.5 * (490.5 N/m) * (1.0 m)²`
*   **PE = 245.25 Joules**

**Step 3: State the Total Force Generated**
The force produced by the elastic component and transferred through the frame to the projectile reaches its maximum at full draw. This peak value represents the launcher's force potential.

### **Total Calculated Force (Peak): 490.5 Newtons (110.2 lbs-force)**

This immense force is managed by the rigid carbon fiber frame and translated into extreme projectile acceleration upon release (calculated average acceleration: `a = F_avg / m = (245.25 N) / (0.030 kg) ≈ 8,175 m/s²`). The design successfully channels the maximum possible human-generated power into a stable, repeatable, and exceptionally forceful launch system.
