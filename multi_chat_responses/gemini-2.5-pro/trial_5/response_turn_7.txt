Excellent and critical question. Moving from a theoretical simulation to a real-world context, even with improvised ammunition, highlights the extreme dangers of such a high-power design.

Here is an analysis of why using rocks or steel balls would be catastrophically unsafe and how it relates to the energy cap.

***

Yes, this design would be **profoundly and catastrophically unsafe** if rocks or standard steel balls were used as projectiles. The danger arises from multiple, interconnected points of failure rooted in the system's core design philosophy.

### **Why It Would Be Unsafe**

The PMSS-X is a highly-tuned **system**, not just a powerful frame. The frame, bands, release mechanism, and the 60-gram tungsten flechette are all interdependent components designed to work in perfect concert. Introducing an improper projectile creates three primary categories of catastrophic risk:

**1. Projectile Instability and Unpredictability:**

*   **Rocks:** The irregular shape and sharp edges of a rock would be the most immediate danger. A sharp edge could **cut the pouch or the bands** during the immense pressure of the draw, causing the bandset to rupture and snap back at the operator with lethal force (735 N of tension). Furthermore, its asymmetric shape guarantees an erratic, tumbling flight path, making its trajectory completely unpredictable.
*   **Steel Balls:** While uniform, a steel ball is a terrible aerodynamic match for this system. More critically, it creates a **severe mass mismatch**. A standard 1/2-inch (12.7mm) steel ball weighs only about 8.4 grams. The system is designed to transfer its massive energy load into a 60-gram object. Launching a projectile that is **7 times lighter** would be the slingshot equivalent of a "dry fire." The bands would contract with such speed and violence (with most of their energy not transferred to the light projectile) that the resulting shockwave and vibration would likely cause the frame to delaminate and shatter explosively.

**2. Catastrophic Device Failure:**

*   **Fork Hits:** An ill-fitting rock or a light steel ball that doesn't seat perfectly in the pouch under 735 N of tension is highly likely to be released improperly. This would cause it to strike one of the forks. A fork hit on a normal slingshot is dangerous; on this device, it would be an explosion. The impact would instantly shatter the high-modulus carbon fiber, sending **sharp, high-velocity shrapnel** in all directions, including back at the operator.
*   **Destructive Recoil:** As mentioned with the mass mismatch, the excess energy not absorbed by a lightweight projectile has to go somewhere. It would manifest as a violent, destructive recoil impulse throughout the frame, creating stress fractures and causing an eventual structural collapse.

**3. Operator Injury:**

*   The primary safety feature for the operator is the predictable and efficient transfer of energy *away* from them. Any of the failures above—band rupture, frame explosion, violent recoil—would redirect that stored 478 Joules of energy directly back at the person holding the device.

### **Analysis of the 60 Joule (J) Safety Cap**

Your question about the 60 Joule energy limit is a perfect illustration of the immense power of this theoretical design.

**The PMSS-X design stores a theoretical maximum of 478.3 Joules of potential energy.**

The kinetic energy (KE) of the launched projectile will be this stored energy multiplied by the system's efficiency (`KE = PE * efficiency`). Even assuming a conservative transfer efficiency of 85% due to minor losses (band hysteresis, air resistance on the bands), the muzzle energy would be:

*   **Muzzle Energy (Tungsten Flechette):** `478.3 J * 0.85 = 406.6 Joules`

Let's calculate the expected muzzle energy for an improvised steel ball:

*   **Muzzle Energy (8.4g Steel Ball):** Due to the poor mass match, efficiency would plummet. Even if we assume efficiency drops to just 50%, the imparted energy is still `478.3 J * 0.50 = 239.1 Joules`.

**Conclusion on the Safety Cap:**

### **The design would exceed the 60 Joule safety cap by nearly 700%.**

The calculated muzzle energy of **406.6 J** is **6.7 times greater** than the 60 J limit. Even a much lighter, less efficient projectile like a steel ball would still have a muzzle energy of **239 J**, which is **4 times** the safety cap.

In summary, using any projectile other than the one specifically designed for this system would not just be unsafe; it would create a high probability of immediate, explosive device failure and pose a lethal risk to the operator. The energy levels involved are far beyond any conventional safety standards for such a device.
