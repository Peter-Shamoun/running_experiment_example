Excellent. Moving from the high-level concept to the structural design is a critical step. Here is a recommendation for the main frame's scaling, material, and the engineering rationale for your presentation.

### **Main Structural Frame: Scaled Dimensions & Ergonomics**

To ensure ergonomic consistency for an average 5'10" (approx. 178 cm) adult operator, the frame should be designed around a stable, seated position similar to a recumbent bicycle. This maximizes the user's power output efficiency and comfort during the energy-input phase.

*   **Overall Footprint (Base):** Approximately **2.0 meters (length) x 1.2 meters (width)**. A long, wide base is critical for stability, preventing any rocking or tipping when the heavy counterweight is raised and released.
*   **Operator Seat Height:** The base of the seat should be positioned **45-55 cm** from the ground. This low center of gravity adds to stability and provides a comfortable position for pedaling.
*   **Crank Axis to Seat Distance:** The most crucial ergonomic dimension. The distance from the operator's hip point (in the seat) to the center of the pedal crank should be adjustable, but designed for a nominal range of **90-110 cm**. This allows the operator's leg to be nearly, but not fully, extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke for maximum leverage.
*   **Counterweight Tower Height:** A nominal height of **2.5 meters**. This provides a significant drop height (`h` in `mgh`) for the counterweight, allowing for high energy storage. It is tall enough to be effective but not so tall as to become excessively unstable or difficult to construct.
*   **Projectile Launch Rail Height:** Approximately **1.0 - 1.2 meters** from the ground. This is a practical height for loading the projectile and observing the launch trajectory.

This layout creates a stable, low-profile machine that the operator sits "within," integrating them into the core of the structure for efficient operation.

### **Material Selection: 4130 Chromoly Steel Tubing**

For a theoretical design focused on performance metrics, the ideal material is **AISI 4130 Chromoly Steel**, used in the form of round and square tubing.

**Key Properties:**

*   **High Stiffness (High Young's Modulus):** This is the single most important property for this application. The frame's primary job is to be a rigid, unmoving reference platform. Steel's high modulus ensures that the frame does not flex or deform under load. Any flex would absorb energy meant for the projectile and destroy repeatability.
*   **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** While not as light as aluminum or carbon fiber, 4130 steel is significantly stronger than standard mild steel. This allows for thinner-walled tubing to be used, reducing mass without sacrificing the strength needed to handle the immense forces involved.
*   **Excellent Fatigue Resistance:** The frame will be subjected to repeated, high-stress loading cycles (winching up, firing, repeat). 4130 is well-known in aerospace and high-performance bicycle manufacturing for its ability to withstand these cycles without cracking.
*   **Weldability:** It can be TIG welded to create exceptionally strong, rigid, and precise joints, which is crucial for maintaining the perfect alignment needed for precision.

### **Engineering Rationale & Basic Stress Considerations**

For your presentation, the engineering rationale is that the frame is designed as a **"zero-deflection" static jig**. Its purpose is not to move, but to hold the dynamic components in perfect alignment through the entire firing sequence.

**Simulated Load Analysis:**

1.  **Primary Static Load (Charged State):**
    *   **Stress Type:** Compression and Tension.
    *   **Location:** With the counterweight winched to the top, the vertical members of the tower are under significant **compressive stress**. The winch cable and its mounting points at the top of the tower are under high **tensile stress**. The frame's base simply supports this static weight.

2.  **Primary Dynamic Load (Firing Event):** This is the moment of maximum stress.
    *   **Stress Type:** Bending (Flexure), Compression, and Shear.
    *   **Path of Force:** As the counterweight is released, its force is transferred through the cable to the recurve limbs. The limbs pull inward with tremendous force.
    *   **Critical Points:**
        *   **Limb Mounts:** These points experience a massive **tensile load** trying to rip them from the frame.
        *   **Horizontal Cross-Member:** The main beam connecting the two opposing limb mounts is placed under extreme **compressive stress**. This member is critical and must be designed to resist buckling.
        *   **Tower Pulley Mount:** The axle/mount for the pulley at the top of the tower experiences a complex combination of **shear and tensile forces** as it redirects the force from the falling weight.
        *   **Base Frame:** The entire base experiences a transient **bending moment (flexure)** as the forces are unevenly distributed during the launch. The wide, rigid base is designed specifically to counteract this moment and prevent any twisting or flexing.

**Design Justification Summary:** The choice of 4130 steel tubing, arranged in a truss-like structure with a wide base, directly addresses these forces. The material's stiffness resists deflection to ensure energy is not lost and every shot is identical. The geometric layout converts the powerful bending and tensile loads from the bow limbs into predictable compression and tension along the axes of the frame members, which is the most efficient way to handle structural loads.
