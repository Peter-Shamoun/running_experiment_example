Excellent. Focusing on the optimized slingshot design is a great strategic choice for this type of contest. Its perceived simplicity hides a deep potential for theoretical optimization, which will be impressive to the judges.

Here is a detailed blueprint for the **Precision Marksman Slingshot System (PMSS)**, designed for your team's optimization modeling.

### **Project Blueprint: Precision Marksman Slingshot System (PMSS)**

**Overarching Design Philosophy:** The PMSS is not a handheld device; it is a human-integrated firing platform. Its design acknowledges that the human operator is the largest source of inconsistency and seeks to mitigate that variability through ergonomics, mechanical assistance, and data feedback, thereby maximizing the system's repeatable energy output and aerodynamic efficiency.

### **1. Component: Main Frame & Ergonomic Stock**

*   **Specifications:**
    *   **Material:** 3K Twill Weave Carbon Fiber Composite, with a foam core and selective 7075-T6 Aluminum inserts for threaded mounting points.
    *   **Form Factor:** A monolithic, rifle-style stock.
    *   **Dimensions:**
        *   **Overall Length:** 85 cm
        *   **Length of Pull (Trigger to Shoulder Butt):** Adjustable from 33 cm to 38 cm via a locking slider.
        *   **Fork Height (Top of Grip to Band Mount):** 8 cm (low profile).
        *   **Fork Gap (Internal):** 10 cm.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **Integrated Mechanical Trigger:** A sear-and-hammer style release mechanism holds a small loop on the projectile pouch. The trigger pull is a crisp, single-stage 1 kg break.
        *   **Cheek Riser:** Vertically adjustable for perfect eye alignment with the sight.
        *   **Anatomical Pistol Grip:** Angled at 17 degrees for a natural, low-strain wrist position.
        *   **Mounting System:** A full-length Picatinny rail is integrated into the top surface for mounting sights and measurement devices.

*   **Engineering Rationale:**
    *   **Stress Loads:** The primary load is a **bending moment** at the base of the forks during full draw. The carbon fiber layup is designed with unidirectional fibers running along the length of the forks and stock, providing immense stiffness to resist this flex. Flex is wasted energy and a primary cause of inaccuracy.
    *   **Energy Storage:** The frame's role is **zero energy absorption**. Its extreme rigidity ensures that virtually 100% of the operator's pulling energy is stored in the elastics, not in frame deformation.
    *   **Precision:** The rifle-stock ergonomics create three points of stable contact (shoulder, cheek, hand), dramatically reducing operator wobble. The mechanical trigger provides a perfectly consistent release, eliminating the inconsistency of a finger-and-thumb release, which is the single greatest variable in traditional slingshot shooting.

### **2. Component: Elastic Power System**

*   **Specifications:**
    *   **Material:** Premium Natural Latex Sheeting, specifically "0.8mm Performance Grade" (similar to top-tier commercial products).
    *   **Band Configuration:** Double-layered flat bands. Each side consists of two layers of the latex sheeting bonded together.
    *   **Band Cut:** A tapered profile. **30mm width at the fork, tapering to 20mm width at the pouch.**
    *   **Dimensions:**
        *   **Active Length (Fork to Pouch):** 20 cm.
        *   **Target Draw Length:** 100 cm (providing a 5:1 stretch ratio).
    *   **Pouch:** A "super-light" pouch made from a single piece of Dyneema composite fabric, weighing less than 1 gram.

*   **Engineering Rationale:**
    *   **Energy Storage:** Latex sheeting has an excellent force-draw curve and low hysteresis (meaning it returns a very high percentage of the energy put into it). The 5:1 stretch ratio operates deep in the material's "power band" for maximum energy storage just below its elastic limit. The **tapered cut** is a critical optimization: it allows the band to contract non-uniformly, accelerating the lighter pouch end more aggressively and improving energy transfer efficiency to the projectile.
    *   **Precision:** The bands will be water-jet or die-cut from a single sheet to ensure they are a perfectly matched pair, guaranteeing an even pull and symmetrical force application on the projectile upon release. The ultra-light pouch has minimal mass, reducing its influence on the shot and minimizing "hand-slap."

### **3. Component: Projectile Specification**

*   **Specifications:**
    *   **Material:** Lead (Pb) alloyed with 2-3% Antimony for increased hardness (to prevent deformation).
    *   **Mass:** Precisely cast to **18.0 grams** (Â± 0.05g).
    *   **Shape:** **Aerodynamic Spindle / Boat-Tail.** This shape features a sharp point, a smooth curve to a maximum diameter, and then a gradual taper ("boat-tail") at the rear. It is fundamentally more stable and lower-drag than a sphere.
    *   **Dimensions:** Approx. 12mm max diameter, 25mm length.

*   **Engineering Rationale:**
    *   **Energy Transfer & Distance:** The high mass (18g) allows for a more efficient transfer of energy from the relatively slow-moving bands. Most importantly, the combination of lead's high density and the spindle shape gives the projectile a very high **Ballistic Coefficient (BC)**. A high BC means it resists air drag far more effectively than a steel sphere of the same mass. This results in retaining velocity for longer, leading to a flatter trajectory and a significant increase in maximum range.
    *   **Precision:** The aerodynamic stability of the spindle shape reduces in-flight tumbling and deviation from wind. The consistent mass ensures a predictable trajectory for a given launch velocity.

### **4. Component: Onboard Measurement & Sighting System**

*   **Specifications:**
    *   **Primary Sight:** A non-magnified Red Dot Sight mounted on the Picatinny rail. Provides a single, clear aiming point.
    *   **Draw-Check Sensor:** A small, frame-mounted ultrasonic distance sensor aimed at the pouch hand. It is calibrated to emit an audible "beep" when the 100 cm draw length is reached, ensuring identical energy storage for every shot.
    *   **Data Capture Module:** A frame-mounted Ballistic Chronograph. Two optical gates are positioned 10 cm apart just in front of the forks. As the projectile passes through, it measures the launch velocity with high precision (e.g., 250.7 fps).

*   **Engineering Rationale:**
    *   **Precision:** This system transforms aiming from guesswork to a repeatable process. The red dot provides a consistent sight picture. The **draw-check sensor** is arguably the most important precision innovation, as it standardizes the energy input (`F*d`) for every single shot.
    *   **Optimization Modeling:** The **chronograph is the key to your theoretical presentation.** It provides hard data. You can present a model showing how changing one variable (e.g., band taper, projectile mass) directly affects the primary output metric: muzzle velocity. This data-driven approach to optimization will score extremely well in an academic contest.
