Excellent and critical question. Moving from a theoretical simulation to considering real-world materials immediately highlights the immense safety implications of such a high-power design.

The short answer is: **Yes, this design would be phenomenally unsafe with rocks or steel balls.** It would not just be dangerous; it would be a near-guaranteed catastrophic failure.

Here’s the detailed breakdown of why, followed by the calculation for the 60J safety cap.

### **Why It Would Be Unsafe: The Physics of Catastrophic Failure**

The Hyperion BFS is a **symbiotic system**, not just a powerful frame. Every component is balanced against the others. Introducing an imperfect projectile like a rock or a sub-optimal one like steel causes a cascade of failure modes:

**1. Projectile Disintegration (Using a Rock):**
*   **The Problem:** The design imparts an average force of **600 Newtons** onto the projectile, with peak forces far higher at the beginning of the launch. A rock, especially one with micro-fractures, is not engineered to withstand these forces.
*   **The Result:** The rock would instantly **shatter inside the pouch** upon release. Instead of one projectile, you now have a cloud of high-velocity shrapnel being fired in unpredictable directions—including backward toward the operator.

**2. Pouch and Band Failure (The Mismatch Problem):**
*   **The Problem:** The Zylon pouch is designed for a perfect, smooth sphere. A rock's irregular and abrasive surface would create stress concentrations, instantly tearing the pouch. The system is designed to transfer energy to a heavy **20.6g** tungsten mass. A much lighter steel ball or rock cannot absorb the energy quickly enough.
*   **The Result:** This is called **impedance mismatch**. The massive bands, contracting at hundreds of meters per second, are essentially "unloaded." All that stored energy (667.5 Joules) has nowhere to go. It violently snaps back, which could shred the bands, destroy the pouch, and send a shockwave through the frame, potentially causing it to delaminate and fail.

**3. Frame Impact and Brittle Fracture:**
*   **The Problem:** Rocks and even imperfect steel balls are not perfectly spherical or balanced. They will tumble unpredictably upon release. The 10 cm fork gap provides very little room for error at these velocities.
*   **The Result:** A near-certain "fork hit." When a projectile traveling at over 200 m/s strikes the high-modulus, brittle carbon fiber frame, the frame will not bend—it will **explode**. The structural integrity would be compromised instantly, turning the entire launcher into shrapnel.

### **Calculation: Exceeding the 60J Safety Cap**

Yes, both options would obliterate the 60J safety cap, even accounting for the severe energy transfer inefficiencies they would cause.

The system stores **667.5 Joules** of potential energy. The kinetic energy of the projectile depends on how efficiently that PE is converted.

**Scenario 1: 12.7mm Steel Ball**
*   **Mass:** A 12.7mm steel ball has a mass of approximately **8.4 grams** (0.0084 kg).
*   **Efficiency Drop:** Due to the mass mismatch, the energy transfer efficiency would drop significantly. Let's be conservative and assume it falls from 90% to just **50%**.
*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = (Stored PE) × (New Efficiency) = 667.5 J × 0.50 = **333.75 Joules**.

**Scenario 2: 12.7mm "Rock" (Granite)**
*   **Mass:** A 12.7mm sphere of granite has a mass of approximately **2.9 grams** (0.0029 kg).
*   **Efficiency Drop:** The mass mismatch is now extreme. The system is grossly overpowered for this light projectile. Let's assume a catastrophic efficiency of only **20%**.
*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = (Stored PE) × (New Efficiency) = 667.5 J × 0.20 = **133.5 Joules**.

| Projectile             | Mass (g) | Est. Energy Transfer | **Calculated KE** | **Exceeds 60J Cap?**    |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Optimized Tungsten      | 20.6     | 90%                  | 600.8 J           | Yes, by **10x**         |
| **Standard Steel Ball** | **8.4**  | **~50%**             | **~334 J**        | **Yes, by over 5.5x**   |
| **Rock (Granite)**      | **2.9**  | **~20%**             | **~134 J**        | **Yes, by over 2.2x**   |

**Conclusion for the Judges:**

The Hyperion BFS's immense power is entirely dependent on the perfect synergy of its components. Using unauthorized projectiles like rocks or steel balls would not only drastically exceed any reasonable safety limit (like the 60J cap) but would also introduce multiple, simultaneous points of catastrophic failure. This highlights a critical engineering principle: in a high-performance system, **safety and performance are not separate variables; they are fundamentally linked through material science and system dynamics.** The design is theoretically dominant precisely because it is a holistic, single-purpose system.
