### **Project Submission: The Ballistic Frame Slingshot (BFS)**
**Team:** [Your University Name] Engineering Society
**Design Objective:** Maximization of Projectile Force and Kinetic Energy

#### **1. General Design & Rationale**

The Ballistic Frame Slingshot (BFS) is a high-performance elastic launcher engineered to overcome the biomechanical limitations of traditional slingshot designs. Standard models are constrained by the user's single-arm wrist and shoulder strength. The BFS integrates a **foot-braced, linear-draw frame**, allowing the operator to use their powerful back and leg muscles for the draw, dramatically increasing the potential energy that can be stored and released.

The core design consists of an elongated, T-shaped frame. The user places their feet on the forward crossbar (the "stirrup") and pulls the pouch and trigger mechanism backward with both hands, similar to loading a high-powered crossbow. This ergonomic framework enables the use of an exceptionally powerful elastic engine, translating a massive draw weight over a long draw length into unprecedented projectile velocity and force.

#### **3. Force and Energy Calculations**

This analysis calculates the force exerted *on the projectile* during launch, derived from the potential energy stored in the elastic engine.

**Assumptions:**
*   The operator can achieve the maximum draw weight using the foot-braced frame.
*   The force curve of the elastic tubes is approximately linear for this calculation.
*   System Energy Efficiency (conversion of PE to KE) is **85%**, accounting for energy loss to band hysteresis and parasitic mass.

**Step 1: Calculate Stored Potential Energy (PE)**
The work done to draw the bands is stored as potential energy. Work = Average Force × Distance.
*   **Maximum Draw Weight (Force_max):** The quad-tube setup is designed for a peak force of **890 N** (~200 lbf).
*   **Average Draw Force (F_avg):** Assuming a linear draw, F_avg = F_max / 2 = 890 N / 2 = **445 N**.
*   **Draw Length (Distance, x):** The frame allows for a 75 cm draw. x = **0.75 m**.
*   **Potential Energy (PE):** PE = F_avg × x = 445 N × 0.75 m = **333.75 Joules**.

**Step 2: Calculate Projectile Kinetic Energy (KE)**
This is the usable energy transferred to the projectile after efficiency losses.
*   **Efficiency (η):** 85% or 0.85.
*   **Kinetic Energy (KE):** KE = PE × η = 333.75 J × 0.85 = **283.7 Joules**.

**Step 3: Calculate Projectile Muzzle Velocity (v)**
From KE = ½mv², we can solve for velocity.
*   **Mass (m):** 0.01134 kg.
*   **Velocity (v):** v = √(2 × KE / m) = √(2 × 283.7 J / 0.01134 kg) = √50035 = **223.7 m/s** (~734 ft/s).

**Step 4: Calculate Total Force Generated (Applied to Projectile)**
This is the average force acting on the projectile during its acceleration down the power stroke.
*   First, calculate acceleration (a) using v² = u² + 2ax (where initial velocity u=0).
*   **Acceleration (a):** a = v² / (2x) = (223.7 m/s)² / (2 × 0.75 m) = 50035 / 1.5 = **33,357 m/s²**. (Approx. 3,400 G's).
*   **Total Force on Projectile (F_proj):** F = ma = 0.01134 kg × 33,357 m/s² = **378.3 Newtons**.

---
**Conclusion:** The Ballistic Frame Slingshot (BFS) design produces a calculated average force of **378 Newtons** on the projectile, launching an 11.34g lead sphere with **283.7 Joules** of kinetic energy. This immense force output, made possible by a biomechanically superior frame and a powerful elastic engine, represents a pinnacle of human-powered launcher performance, positioning it to dominate the competition in force and distance metrics.
