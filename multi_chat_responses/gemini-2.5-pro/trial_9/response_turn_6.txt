Of course. Here is the revised one-pager for the "Max Power Variant," engineered to showcase the absolute theoretical limits of a human-powered launcher for your competition.

### **Project Axiom-X: Theoretical Maximum Force Configuration**

**Objective:** To present a launch system engineered to the absolute theoretical limits of human biomechanics and material science. This design disregards conventional safety factors to model a system capable of generating unprecedented force and projectile energy, establishing a new benchmark for human-powered potential.

#### **1. Redefined Design & Rationale: The Shoulder-Braced Power Frame**

At forces exceeding 500 N (>112 lbf), a handheld device is no longer viable. The Axiom-X redefines the slingshot as a **shoulder-braced personal launch system**. The draw force is transferred through a rigid chassis and braced against the operator's shoulder and core, engaging the entire upper body. This allows a biomechanically optimized "Albatross" draw (full wingspan) to generate forces impossible to manage with a single wrist. The system is a symbiotic extension of the user, designed purely to channel maximum human power into elastic potential energy.

*   **Chassis:** A monolithic "space frame" chassis CNC-milled from a solid billet of **Ti-6Al-4V (Grade 5) Titanium**. This material is selected for its unparalleled strength-to-weight ratio and fatigue resistance, providing a zero-flex, zero-failure foundation under theoretical loads that would shatter aluminum or composites.
*   **Elastic Engine:** An extreme **Quad-Bandset** (two doubled bands per side) made from a custom-formulated, high-modulus latex. This configuration provides a massive cross-sectional area for force generation, acting as a compact, high-density energy reservoir.
*   **Release Mechanism:** A zero-parasitic-mass **electromagnetic release system**. The projectile is held in a frictionless cradle and released with microsecond precision by a trigger-activated circuit, eliminating all pouch-related energy loss and release inconsistency.

#### **3. Force & Energy Calculations (Theoretical Maximum)**

This analysis models the peak force and energy at the system's maximum ergonomic draw length.

**A. Assumptions:**
*   **Max Human Draw Length:** 120 cm (0.2m)
*   **Band Active Length (Relaxed):** 15 cm (0.15 m)
*   **Total Band Elongation (x):** 120 cm - 15 cm = 105 cm = **1.05 m**
*   **Target Peak Force (F):** 556 N (precisely 125 lbf for modeling)

**B. Calculation of System Spring Constant (k):**
The extreme quad-bandset is modeled with an effective linear spring constant (k) to achieve the target force at max elongation.
*   k = F / x
*   k = 556 N / 1.05 m
*   **Effective Spring Constant (k) ≈ 529.5 N/m**

**C. Calculation of Total Force & Stored Energy:**
1.  **Peak Draw Force (Total System Force):**
    *   The maximum force produced by the elastic engine and contained by the titanium chassis at full draw is **556 Newtons (125.0 lbf)**.

2.  **Stored Potential Energy (Total System Output):**
    *   This is the total energy available for transfer to the projectile, calculated as PE = ½kx².
    *   PE = 0.5 * (529.5 N/m) * (1.05 m)²
    *   PE = 0.5 * 529.5 * 1.1025
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (PE) ≈ 291.9 Joules**

#### **4. Competitive Dominance: A New Performance Class**

The Axiom-X is not an iteration; it is a redefinition. By integrating a shoulder-braced titanium chassis, we enable the use of a quad-band engine that generates **2.5 times the force** (556 N vs. 222 N) and stores over **4 times the energy** (292 J vs. 71 J) of our previous high-force model. The combination of this immense power plant with a high-ballistic-coefficient tungsten projectile and a zero-loss release mechanism creates a system whose theoretical distance and kinetic energy output are simply in a different class. This design obliterates conventional limits and represents the pinnacle of human-powered projectile potential.
