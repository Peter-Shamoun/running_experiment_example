Of course. To win on the metric of maximum force, the design must be aggressive, leveraging the strongest materials and a configuration that multiplies force directly. This one-page document outlines a theoretical design—the "LEA-Maximus"—built for the single purpose of generating and withstanding the highest possible human-powered draw force.

### **Project LEA-Maximus: A Force-Optimized Linear Elastic Accelerator**
**Submission by: [Your University Engineering Society, Team Name]**

#### **1. Design Overview**

The LEA-Maximus is a stationary, ground-anchored platform designed to achieve the theoretical maximum draw force from a human-powered elastic system. The design philosophy prioritizes brute strength and structural rigidity over portability or speed of use. By decoupling the operator's stability from the device and using a mechanical assist for the draw, we can focus solely on maximizing the potential energy stored in the power plant. The system consists of three core components: an overbuilt Chromoly steel tension frame, a high-density parallel-laminated latex power plant, and a heavy-duty mechanical trigger for safe, repeatable release.

#### **2. Component Specifications & Rationale**

**A. Main Tension Frame**
*   **Material:** **4130 Chromoly Steel Tubing (Normalized)**.
    *   **Rationale:** Chosen for its exceptional tensile strength, rigidity, and high fatigue limit. Unlike composites, steel provides superior resistance to the crushing and shear forces at the anchor and trigger points. Its mass provides essential stability for the stationary platform.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Main Spars:** 3.0-inch diameter round tubing, 0.125-inch wall thickness.
    *   **Overall Footprint:** 8 feet long x 4 feet wide. This enlarged A-frame geometry provides an exceptionally stable base and allows for a massive draw length.
    *   **Reinforcement:** All joints are gusseted with 1/4-inch steel plate to eliminate flex under load. The frame includes integrated floor anchor points.

**B. Elastic Power Plant**
*   **Material:** **Layered TheraBand Gold™ Natural Latex Sheeting**.
    *   **Rationale:** This material offers one of the highest energy storage densities available. The design uses a parallel-laminated configuration, where the total force is the direct sum of the force from each individual band layer.
*   **Measurements:**
    *   **Configuration:** **Ten (10) layers** of latex per side, for a total of twenty layers.
    *   **Band Geometry:** Each layer is a tapered cut: **2.0 inches wide** at the frame anchor, tapering to **1.5 inches wide** at the pouch anchor.
    *   **Active Length:** 12 inches (at rest).

**C. Release & Projectile System**
*   **Release Mechanism:** **Sear-Actuated Jaw Trigger, machined from Hardened A2 Tool Steel.**
    *   **Rationale:** A finger-release is impossible at these force levels. A heavy-duty mechanical trigger is the only way to ensure a safe and perfectly consistent release. A2 tool steel is required to prevent deformation of the sear surfaces under the immense point load.
*   **Projectile:** **50mm (2-inch) diameter, 52100 Chrome Steel Ball Bearing.**
    *   **Rationale:** At this energy level, a massive projectile is needed to efficiently absorb the power. A large, dense sphere maximizes the ballistic coefficient for downrange energy retention.

#### **3. Force & Energy Analysis**

The total force is calculated by determining the force of a single band layer at maximum extension and multiplying it by the total number of layers.

**A. Key Measurements & Assumptions:**
*   **Max Draw Length (x):** 48 inches (1.22 m).
*   **Active Band Length (L₀):** 12 inches (0.305 m).
*   **Elongation Ratio:** (48" / 12") = 4.0, or 400% elongation.
*   **Force Constant (k):** Based on empirical data, TheraBand Gold produces approx. 6.0 lbs of force per inch of width at 100% elongation. We assume a linear force response for this model.

**B. Calculation of Force per Component (Single Band Layer):**
1.  **Force at 400% Elongation:** The force scales with the elongation ratio.
    *   Force = (Force Constant) x (Elongation Ratio) = 6.0 lbs/inch x 4 = **24 lbs per inch of width**.

2.  **Average Width of Tapered Band:**
    *   Average Width = (2.0" + 1.5") / 2 = **1.75 inches**.

3.  **Peak Force per Single Band Layer (F_band):**
    *   F_band = (Force per inch of width) x (Average Width) = 24 lbs/inch x 1.75 inches = **42 lbs**.

**C. Calculation of Total System Force (F_total):**
1.  **Total Number of Bands (N):** 10 layers/side x 2 sides = **20 layers**.

2.  **Total Peak Draw Force (F_total):** The final, measurable force output of the device.
    *   F_total = (Force per Band) x (Total Number of Bands) = 42 lbs x 20 = **840 lbs**.
    *   **F_total in Newtons:** 840 lbs x 4.448 N/lb = **3,736 Newtons**.

### **Conclusion: Maximum Optimized Force Output**

The LEA-Maximus design achieves a theoretical **Peak Draw Force of 840 pounds (3,736 N)**. This is accomplished by using a massively overbuilt steel frame to withstand the tension generated by a high-density power plant of 20 parallel latex layers. This force allows for the storage of approximately **2,280 Joules of potential energy**, representing the apex of force optimization in a human-powered elastic launcher design.
