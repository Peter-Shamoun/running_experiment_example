Excellent question. Moving from the abstract concept to the physical structure is the critical next step. A well-designed frame is what translates theoretical precision into practical repeatability.

Here is a breakdown of the frame design, tailored for your presentation and analysis.

### **Main Structural Frame: The "Spinal Truss"**

The frame's primary job is to maintain perfect alignment between the user, the flywheel, and the launch arm pivot under extreme dynamic loads. A rigid, triangulated design is essential.

### **Ergonomic Scaling & Dimensions (for a ~5'10" user)**

The design should be based on a recumbent configuration to maximize user comfort and power output. Adjustability is a key feature for consistency.

*   **Overall Footprint:** Approximately **6 feet (183 cm) long x 3 feet (91 cm) wide**. This provides a stable base to resist tipping and twisting forces during launch.
*   **Main Boom:** This is the central "spine" of the frame.
*   **Seat Position:** A molded bucket seat is mounted on an adjustable track along the main boom. The seatback should be angled at **~35-45 degrees** from the horizontal.
*   **Crankset (Bottom Bracket) Position:** Also mounted on an adjustable track on the main boom. The key ergonomic measurement is the **X-Seam**, the distance from the seat's back-rest to the pedals. For a 5'10" user, this should be adjustable in the range of **42-46 inches (107-117 cm)** to ensure optimal leg extension.
*   **Flywheel Mount:** The flywheel should be mounted low and centrally within the frame's wheelbase, just behind the crankset. This lowers the center of gravity, dramatically increasing stability.
*   **Launch Arm Pivot:** This should be mounted on a heavily reinforced vertical structure at the rear of the frame, approximately **24-30 inches (61-76 cm)** above the ground.

### **Suggested Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

For a theoretical design balancing performance and feasibility, 6061-T6 Aluminum is an ideal choice. It is commonly available in square and rectangular tubing, which simplifies construction compared to round tubes.

**Key Properties:**

*   **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** Significantly lighter than steel for equivalent strength, reducing the overall inertia of the system that doesn't contribute to the launch.
*   **Excellent Stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity):** Resists bending and flexing under load, which is crucial for maintaining the precise alignment needed for repeatability.
*   **Good Machinability & Weldability:** Allows for the creation of precise mounting points and strong joints.
*   **Predictable Failure Mode:** It will yield (bend) before it fractures, which is a desirable characteristic from a design analysis perspective.

**Frame Specification:** Use **2-inch x 2-inch square tubing** with a **1/8-inch (3.2 mm) wall thickness** for the main structural members.

### **Engineering Rationale & Stress Considerations (For Presentation)**

Your presentation should focus on how the frame is intelligently designed to manage specific, predictable forces.

**1. Primary Design Philosophy: A Space Frame / Truss Structure**
The frame is not a simple rectangle; it's a fully triangulated space frame. Triangles are the most rigid geometric shape, ensuring that forces are distributed as pure tension and compression along the members, rather than as difficult-to-manage bending moments.

**2. Key Load Cases & Stress Analysis:**

*   **Load Case A: Drivetrain Torsion**
    *   **Source:** The user pedaling. This action applies a cyclical twisting force (torsion) to the main boom connecting the crankset to the flywheel drivetrain.
    *   **Stress Consideration:** Without proper bracing, this torsion would cause the boom to twist, misaligning the chain/belt and wasting energy.
    *   **Design Solution:** The wide, triangulated base of the frame acts as a "torsion box," providing immense resistance to this twisting force and ensuring every watt of human power is delivered efficiently to the flywheel.

*   **Load Case B: Peak Launch Torque (The Critical Event)**
    *   **Source:** The instant the clutch engages, transferring the flywheel's immense kinetic energy to the launch arm. Per Newton's Third Law, the massive torque that accelerates the arm forward applies an equal and opposite torque to the frame via the launch arm's pivot point.
    *   **Stress Consideration:** This is the single largest and most sudden load the frame will experience. It will attempt to violently twist and lift the rear of the frame. The highest stress concentrations will occur at the welds and bolt holes connecting the launch pivot assembly to the main frame.
    *   **Design Solution:**
        *   **Gusseting:** Additional triangular plates (gussets) are welded at the junction of the main frame and the vertical pivot mount. This distributes the concentrated load over a much larger area.
        *   **Targeted Reinforcement:** The tubing around the pivot mount could be specified with a thicker wall (e.g., 1/4-inch) or have an internal sleeve to prevent local crushing and deformation at the bolt points.

*   **Load Case C: Gyroscopic Precession**
    *   **Source:** The high-RPM flywheel acts as a gyroscope. If the frame flexes *at all* during the launch event, this gyroscopic action will induce a powerful precession force (a torque perpendicular to both the flywheel's axis and the flex axis).
    *   **Stress Consideration:** This force would try to yaw the entire machine sideways, completely ruining precision.
    *   **Design Solution:** This provides the ultimate justification for a high-stiffness frame. Your analysis can state that the frame's rigidity is not just for strength, but is **essential to counteract gyroscopic forces** and ensure the projectile's release path is perfectly planar and repeatable. This demonstrates a deep, university-level understanding of the physics at play.
