        *   **Width:** 15.0 mm
        *   **Edge Finish:** All edges to be rounded with a 1.0 mm radius to prevent band abrasion.

*   **3.1.4 Handle Specifications:**
    *   **Handle Length (grip area):** 85.0 mm

    *   **Pinky Rest:** Integrated subtle curve at the base of the handle.
    *   **Lanyard Hole:** 6.0 mm diameter, chamfered on both sides.

#### **3.2 Elastic Power Assembly**

    *   **Material:** Multi-layer Natural Latex Rubber Sheeting
    *   **Grade:** Premium grade, 0.70 mm nominal thickness
    *   **Color:** Amber/Natural
    *   **Durometer (Shore A):** 35 ± 5

*   **3.2.2 Elastic Band Dimensions:**
    *   **Cut Style:** Tapered Cut
    *   **Width at Fork End:** 22.0 mm
    *   **Width at Pouch End:** 15.0 mm
    *   **Active Length (un-stretched, from pouch to fork):** 180.0 mm per side

*   **3.2.3 Band Attachment Hardware:**
    *   **Method:** Wrap-and-tuck using a secondary binding strip.
    *   **Binding Strip Material:** Amber Belt, 0.5 mm thick, 10 mm wide.
    *   **Procedure:** A 150 mm length of binding strip is wrapped tightly over the main band within the fork tip groove and secured with a locking tuck. This provides a secure, low-profile attachment that minimizes stress concentration.

#### **3.3 Pouch**

*   **3.3.1 Pouch Material:**
    *   **Type:** High-strength, non-stretch, dual-layer microfiber composite.
    *   **Outer Layer:** Abrasion-resistant synthetic suede.

    *   **Secondary Operations:** All edges, including internal cutouts, are machine-deburred and then hand-finished to a smooth, rounded profile (minimum 1.0 mm radius) to eliminate stress points and ensure user comfort.

*   **4.2 Surface Finish:**
    *   **Preparation:** Fine glass bead blast to achieve a uniform, non-reflective matte texture.
    *   **Coating:** Type II Sulfuric Acid Anodizing per MIL-A-8625F.

    *   **Thickness:** 18-25 micrometers.
    *   **Purpose:** Enhances surface hardness, provides excellent corrosion and abrasion resistance, and creates a tactile, high-friction grip surface.

### **5.0 Performance Specifications (Calculated & Empirical)**

These specifications are based on the components defined above, assuming standard atmospheric conditions (20°C, 1 atm).

*   **5.1 Draw Parameters:**
    *   **Draw Length (x):** 81.0 cm (0.81 m)
        *   *Definition: The distance from the rear face of the fork to the pouch at full extension, measured from a consistent anchor point (e.g., corner of the mouth).*
    *   **Maximum Elongation Ratio:** 450% (Calculated as: 81.0 cm / 18.0 cm = 4.5)
    *   **Calculated Peak Draw Force (F_max):** 165 Newtons (approx. 37.1 lbf or 16.8 kgf)
        *   *Based on empirical data for 0.70mm latex at a 4.5 elongation ratio.*

*   **5.2 Energy Storage & Transfer:**
    *   **Calculated Stored Potential Energy (PE):** 52.5 Joules
        *   *Calculated using the integral of the force-draw curve, approximated as PE ≈ 0.4 * F_max * x for this type of tapered latex.*
    *   **Assumed System Efficiency (η):** 75%
        *   *This accounts for energy losses due to band hysteresis, air resistance of the bands, and non-elastic deformation. This is a realistic efficiency for a well-tuned flat-band system.*
    *   **Calculated Muzzle Kinetic Energy (KE):** 39.4 Joules
        *   *Formula: KE = PE * η*

*   **5.3 Projectile Dynamics:**
    *   **Projectile Mass (m):** 0.0035 kg (3.50 grams)
    *   **Calculated Muzzle Velocity (v):** 150.0 meters/second (approx. 492 feet/second)
