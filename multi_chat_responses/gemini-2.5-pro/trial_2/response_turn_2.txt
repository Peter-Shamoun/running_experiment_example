Excellent question. Moving from a high-level concept to a more defined structure is a critical step. Here is a breakdown of the structural frame design, focusing on dimensions, material choice, and the engineering rationale you can present to the judges.

### **Structural Frame: Ergonomic Scaling & Key Dimensions**

The goal is to create a stable, rigid platform that allows an average adult operator (assumed ~5'10" or 178 cm, ~175 lbs or 80 kg) to use the device safely and consistently. The frame should be an **A-frame configuration** for inherent stability.

**Key Dimensions:**

*   **Operator Platform Drop Height (h):**
    *   **Dimension:** 1.5 feet (approx. 45 cm).
    *   **Ergonomic Rationale:** This height is a comfortable and safe single step up for most adults, minimizing risk of imbalance. It provides a significant and easily calculable potential energy input (`E = mgh`). A greater height would increase energy but also risk and structural load.

*   **Overall Footprint (Base):**
    *   **Dimensions:** 6 feet long x 4 feet wide (approx. 1.8m x 1.2m).
    *   **Ergonomic Rationale:** A wide stance is critical to prevent tipping, especially when the high tension of the limbs is released. The length accommodates the full draw of the cable-pulley system and keeps the operator safely behind the launch mechanism. This footprint ensures the center of gravity remains well within the base supports during operation.

*   **Overall Height:**
    *   **Dimension:** 7 feet (approx. 2.1m).
    *   **Ergonomic Rationale:** This provides ample clearance for the operator to stand comfortably on the platform at its highest point without feeling constrained, and it allows sufficient vertical space for the pulley system to function without interference.

*   **Limb Mounting Beam Height:**
    *   **Dimension:** 3 feet (approx. 0.9m) from the ground.
    *   **Ergonomic Rationale:** Mounting the recurve limbs at this height provides a clean, horizontal pull path for the cable and keeps the projectile at a convenient height for loading and inspection.




### **Material Selection: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

For a theoretical contest emphasizing optimization, 6061-T6 aluminum is an outstanding choice. It represents a superb balance between performance and practicality.

*   **Material:** **6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**, likely in the form of square or rectangular extruded tubing (e.g., 2"x2" with a 1/8" wall thickness).

*   **Key Properties for Presentation:**
    *   **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio:** It provides excellent structural integrity without the excessive mass of steel, making the theoretical device more efficient and easier to transport.
    *   **Yield Strength:** ~276 MPa (40,000 psi). This is the critical value for calculating when the material will start to permanently deform.
    *   **Stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity):** ~69 GPa. While not as stiff as steel, it's sufficient to minimize frame flexion under load, which is crucial for precision.
    *   **Corrosion Resistance:** Excellent for a device intended for both indoor and outdoor testing environments.
    *   **Machinability & Workability:** It's easily cut, drilled, and welded (with proper technique), making the theoretical fabrication process plausible and efficient.

### **Engineering Rationale & Basic Stress Considerations**

This is where you demonstrate your engineering rigor to the judges. The primary goal of the frame is to resist deformation under load to ensure every launch is identical.

**Simulated Load Case:**
Assume an 80 kg operator and a pulley system that creates a **4:1 mechanical advantage**. If the recurve limbs have a peak draw weight of 200 lbs (~900 N), the cables will exert a combined tensile force of **800 lbs (~3600 N)** on the frame.

**Primary Stresses to Analyze:**

1.  **Bending Stress (Flexure) on the Limb Mounting Beam:**
    *   **Rationale:** The front horizontal beam, where the two recurve limbs are mounted, is the most critical structural member. The 800 lbs of tension from the drawn "string" will try to bend this beam inwards.
    *   **Analysis Point:** The maximum bending moment will occur at the center of this beam. Your presentation would state that you would use the formula `σ = Mc/I` to ensure the stress is well below aluminum's yield strength. To resist this, you'd specify a beam profile with a high moment of inertia (`I`), such as a tall rectangular tube oriented vertically, or even a lightweight I-beam profile. *The key takeaway is that minimizing flexion here directly translates to improved shot-to-shot consistency.*

2.  **Compressive Stress and Buckling in the A-Frame Legs:**
    *   **Rationale:** The legs of the A-frame are under compression from both the operator's weight and the tension forces channeled through the frame.
    *   **Analysis Point:** For long, slender columns, the primary failure mode is not crushing but **buckling**. Your analysis would highlight the need to check against Euler's critical load formula (`P_cr = π²EI / L²`) to ensure the legs are robust enough not to buckle. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of structural failure modes.

3.  **Shear Stress at Joints:**
    *   **Rationale:** The points where beams are joined (via bolts or welds) are subject to significant shear forces.
    *   **Analysis Point:** Your design would incorporate **gussets** (triangular reinforcement plates) at major T-joints, particularly where the limb mounting beam connects to the A-frame legs. This distributes the load over a larger area, reducing stress concentration and preventing joint failure. You would specify high-grade bolts (e.g., Grade 8) and calculate the shear stress on them to ensure they are within a safe operating limit.

By presenting these three considerations, you show the judges that you've moved beyond a simple sketch and have thought critically about how real-world forces would affect your design's performance, directly linking your structural choices back to the contest's core metrics of precision and repeatability.
