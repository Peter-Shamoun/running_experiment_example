Of course. Here is a one-page document outlining a force-optimized design based on our discussions. This design, "Project KRAKEN," uses mechanical advantage to achieve a massive peak force far beyond what a human could generate directly, positioning it as a top contender.

**Submission for University Engineering Society Design Contest**
**Objective:** Maximization of System Force Output

### **1. General Design Overview**

Project KRAKEN is a human-powered projectile launcher designed to maximize potential energy storage by multiplying human input force through mechanical advantage. The system is a stationary, lever-actuated slingshot mounted on a rigid, ground-stabilized chassis. The operator uses a long lever arm to draw a high-tension, quad-band elastic assembly to its optimal length. This design decouples the system's maximum force from the operator's physical strength, allowing for a peak force an order of magnitude greater than a traditional handheld slingshot, while ensuring stability and repeatability through its rigid frame and mechanical trigger.

| Component | Material | Key Specifications & Measurements |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Chassis & Frame**| 4130 Chromoly Steel Tubing | **Footprint:** 48" L x 24" W. **Frame Height:** 20". **Tubing:** 1.5" diameter, 0.120" wall thickness. |
| **Actuation Lever** | 4130 Chromoly Steel Tubing | **Total Length:** 42". **Effort Arm:** 36" (grip to pivot). **Load Arm:** 6" (pivot to band catch). |

| **Pivot & Trigger** | Hardened Tool Steel | **Lever Pivot:** Grade 8 shoulder bolt with roller bearings. **Trigger:** Multi-sear mechanical release. |

### **3. Rationale for Force Optimization**

*   **Chassis & Frame:** 4130 Chromoly steel was selected for its exceptional yield strength (~460 MPa), ensuring zero frame flexion under the immense tensile load of the drawn bands. A rigid frame is critical for translating all stored energy into the projectile.
*   **Actuation Lever:** The lever is the core of our force-maximization strategy. It functions as a **Class 2 Lever**, providing a significant mechanical advantage. This allows a human operator to comfortably generate and hold a system force that would otherwise be impossible.
*   **Elastic Assembly:** A quad-band configuration sums the force of four individual tapered bands, directly multiplying the base force. The 1.0mm thick latex is chosen for its high potential energy storage capacity per unit of mass.
*   **Projectile:** The heavy 16.5g steel sphere is necessary to efficiently accept the massive energy impulse from this high-force system, maximizing kinetic energy transfer and downrange performance.

### **4. System Force Calculations**

The total force of the KRAKEN system is the combined peak tensile force of the elastic assembly at full draw.

**Assumptions & Definitions:**
*   **Target Draw Length (ΔL):** 30 inches (0.762 m). This is the distance the pouch is drawn back from rest.
*   **Force Constant (k) per Band:** Based on empirical data for 1.0mm tapered latex, a single band set exhibits an approximate force constant of **k ≈ 2.5 lbs/inch**.
*   **Mechanical Advantage (MA):** Calculated from the lever arm lengths.
    `MA = Effort Arm / Load Arm = 36 inches / 6 inches = 6`

**Step 1: Calculate the Force of a Single Band Set at Full Draw**
The force (`F`) is calculated using the force constant (`k`) and the draw length (`ΔL`).
`F_single = k * ΔL`
`F_single = 2.5 lbs/inch * 30 inches = 75 lbf`

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Force of the Quad-Band Assembly**
The forces of the four parallel bands are additive.
`F_total = F_single * 4`
`F_total = 75 lbf * 4 = 300 lbf`

**Step 3: Calculate the Required Operator Input Force**
This demonstrates the feasibility of the system for a human operator.
`F_operator = F_total / MA`
`F_operator = 300 lbf / 6 = 50 lbf`
An input force of 50 lbs is well within the capability of an average adult, making the design practical.

### **Total Generated System Force**

The total peak static force generated by the design and held by the trigger mechanism at full draw is **300 pounds-force (lbf)**, which is equivalent to approximately **1,334 Newtons**. This massive force, achieved through the strategic use of force summation and mechanical advantage, ensures that Project KRAKEN is a design maximally optimized for the competition's force output metric.
