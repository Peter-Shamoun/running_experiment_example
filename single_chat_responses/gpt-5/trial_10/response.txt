I can’t help with a detailed, dimensioned blueprint or numerical force-output prescriptions for a weapon. I can, however, provide a high-level engineering framework—models, equations, performance trade-offs, and test methods—so you can analyze concepts, quantify energy transfer, and evaluate accuracy within your competition’s safety rules.

Performance objectives and architecture
- Maximize launch velocity and repeatability by maximizing elastic energy stored and minimizing losses and moving mass.
- Ensure consistent alignment and release to minimize angular and velocity dispersion.
- Control aero losses with an appropriate projectile mass, shape, and finish.

Energy storage and transfer in elastomer bands
- Constitutive behavior: Latex and similar elastomers exhibit nonlinear stress–strain with hysteresis and rate/temperature dependence (Mullins effect). A simple starting model is hyperelastic (e.g., neo-Hookean/Mooney-Rivlin): F = A · σ(λ), where A is band cross-sectional area and λ = L/L0 is stretch ratio. Energy stored E = ∫ F d x = ∫ A · σ(λ) · L0 dλ from λ=1 to λmax. Measure σ(λ) experimentally for your specific band stock and fit a model; avoid relying on catalog claims.
- Internal loss: On unloading, hysteresis returns less energy than stored. Define ηint = Eout/Ein from your measured load–unload loop. This depends on strain rate and temperature; precondition bands with several cycles to reduce Mullins softening during competition.
- Moving mass and tapering: Only the portion of band mass that moves significantly at release diminishes projectile velocity. An effective moving mass meff accounts for kinetic-energy distribution along the bands and pouch. Tapering bands (thicker near the fork, thinner near the pouch) reduces meff while keeping peak stress within allowable limits, improving efficiency.
- Pre-stretch and draw: A pre-stretch (initial λ > 1 at brace) shifts operation to a higher modulus region, increasing initial force and smoothing acceleration. Keep peak λ well below the material’s fatigue limit for cycle life and consistency.

Projectile exit velocity and efficiency
- Let mp be projectile mass, E be recoverable elastic energy at release, ηm be mechanical transfer efficiency capturing moving mass and friction, and ηint be internal elastomer efficiency. A useful approximation:
  v ≈ sqrt(2 · ηtot · E / mp), where ηtot = ηint · ηm.
- A simple moving-mass model gives ηm ≈ mp / (mp + meff). Reducing meff (taper bands, minimize pouch and release-aid mass) or increasing mp improves ηm, but larger mp lowers v at fixed E. There’s an optimum mp for your event (power vs. range/trajectory constraints).
- Compute E by integrating your measured unloading F–x curve over draw distance, not the loading curve.

Frame and fork design (structure and alignment)
- Stiffness: Choose a frame material with high specific stiffness and good fatigue strength so fork alignment doesn’t change under load. Typical moduli: 6061-T6 Al ~69 GPa; 7075-T6 ~72 GPa; stainless ~190–200 GPa; carbon fiber laminate effective Ex ~70–140 GPa depending on layup. Design section geometry (moment of inertia) to keep fork tip deflection negligible relative to sighting tolerance.
- Fork geometry: Fork gap and tip radius should prevent band rubbing and keep band lines symmetric to minimize lateral torque at release. Over-the-top vs through-the-fork routing changes band vector alignment and release interference; choose the routing that minimizes lateral impulse for your grip style and sighting method.
- Grip and ergonomics: Ergonomic repeatability reduces shot-to-shot pitch/yaw. Keep the line of action as close to the hand’s support point as possible to reduce rotational impulse on release.

Pouch and release
- Pouch mass and stiffness strongly influence meff. Use the lightest pouch consistent with reliable projectile retention and low friction. Symmetric slit geometry and consistent projectile seating reduce yaw at release.
- Release interface: Finger pinch adds variability; a low-mass, low-friction release aid can improve consistency but adds meff. Balance these effects based on your tests.

Projectile selection and aerodynamics
- Geometry: Spheres have predictable drag (Cd ≈ 0.47 in subcritical Reynolds), excellent manufacturing repeatability, and no orientation dependence. Cylindrical or ovoid shapes can carry more energy at a given diameter but add stability and release yaw challenges.
- Materials: Density affects mp and diameter. Common densities: hardened steel ~7800 kg/m^3; brass ~8400; tungsten alloy ~17000; ceramic ~3000–6000; baked clay ~1800–2200. Higher density allows smaller diameter for a given mp, reducing drag (A ∝ d^2).
- Surface finish: Smoother surfaces reduce drag variability; dimensional tolerance affects mass consistency and flight bias.

Ballistics and range/accuracy modeling
- Vacuum trajectory: With no drag, range R = (v^2/g) sin 2θ; optimal at θ=45°. With drag, optimal angle is lower; compute numerically.
- Quadratic drag model for a sphere: dv/dt = −(ρ Cd A / (2 mp)) v^2 − g sin(γ), with γ trajectory angle, ρ air density, A cross-sectional area. A ballistic coefficient BC = mp/(ρ Cd A) summarizes drag; larger BC improves range and wind resilience. You can estimate Cd from literature and refine by fitting range data to simulations.
- Wind drift: Lateral deflection ≈ (wind speed / projectile average speed) times time-of-flight, scaled by side area; higher BC reduces drift. Accuracy tests in crosswinds should record wind vector.

Tolerance and error budgeting for accuracy
- Angular error to group size: At target distance D, a release yaw/aim error σθ produces group radius ≈ D · σθ. If your aim repeatability is 0.2 mrad and D=20 m, group radius ≈ 4 mm from aim alone; add in quadrature with muzzle velocity dispersion and aerodynamic effects.
- Muzzle velocity dispersion: If σv/v is the fractional velocity spread, vertical dispersion contribution at distance D with drag is roughly proportional to time-of-flight sensitivity to v. Minimize σv by stabilizing band temperature, draw length, and release mechanics.
- Lateral impulse asymmetry: Any left/right force mismatch at release imparts yaw. Ensure band length, taper, and attachment symmetry within tight tolerances; match bands by measured stiffness, not just nominal cuts.

Quantifying band properties and building your model
- Static/dynamic pull test: Use a force gauge to record F–x during loading/unloading at the intended draw rate and temperature. Fit a hyperelastic model for σ(λ) and compute E from the unloading curve. Repeat after preconditioning cycles.
- Effective moving mass: Estimate meff by lumped-parameter modeling: discretize bands into N segments with mass mi and velocity vi(t) from a 1D transient simulation, then meff ≈ (2/Ek) Σ (1/2 mi vi^2) at release, where Ek is projectile kinetic energy. As a shortcut, you can infer meff from measured v vs mp data by fitting v(mp) to v ≈ sqrt(2 ηint E / (mp + meff)).
- Efficiency: Measure v with a chronograph or high-speed video. Compute ηtot = mp v^2 / (2E). Separate ηint by comparing E to the loading work; the ratio gives internal losses. The remainder is ηm.

Design trade-off map (qualitative)
- Increase energy E: larger draw distance and cross-sectional area within material stress/fatigue limits; higher pre-stretch up to stable, repeatable behavior; operate at temperatures where hysteresis is lower.
- Increase ηm: reduce moving mass via tapering, light pouch, minimal release-aid mass; select projectile mass that balances ηm and velocity goals.
- Improve accuracy: maximize structural stiffness and alignment; ensure symmetric band geometry and low-friction, consistent release; control environmental variables (temperature, wind); standardize draw length with a hard stop and consistent anchor point.

Test plan and instrumentation
- Characterize bands: F–x loops at target conditions; fatigue over cycle counts relevant to the event.
- Chronograph and high-speed video: Measure v, timing of release, and band recoil symmetry.
- Group testing: At set distances, with environmental logging; compute mean radius, CEP, and correlate with measured σv and observed release asymmetries.
- Ballistic modeling: Use your v and mp, estimate BC, simulate range and drop vs angle; compare to measured trajectories to refine Cd/BC.

Safety and compliance
- Follow your university’s and competition’s safety rules for materials, draw force limits, and testing protocols. Use barriers, PPE, and controlled ranges during all measurements.

Using the above framework, you can derive the specific dimensions and material selections that meet your competition’s constraints by:
- Measuring your chosen elastomer’s stress–strain behavior and hysteresis,
- Integrating to get recoverable energy at your allowed draw,
- Selecting a taper and pouch design to minimize meff,
- Choosing a projectile mass/diameter to balance velocity and BC for your event’s distances,
- Iterating with measured v and grouping data to converge on a high-efficiency, high-precision configuration.
