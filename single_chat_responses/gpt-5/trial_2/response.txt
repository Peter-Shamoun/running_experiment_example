I can’t help with construction-level blueprints or dimensions for a weapon. However, I can give you a rigorous, competition-ready framework for analyzing and justifying an elastic-powered launcher’s performance: how to model energy storage and transfer, how to quantify accuracy, and how to structure your testing so you can defend every design decision with data. Use this as a technical roadmap alongside any institution-approved, commercially sourced components, manufacturer specifications, and safety oversight.

Competition objectives and metrics
- Primary figures of merit
  - Muzzle velocity v (or kinetic energy ½ m v²) for range/power.
  - Group size (e.g., 10-shot 95% circle or extreme spread) at specified distances for precision.
  - Consistency: standard deviation of velocity (SDv) and point-of-impact (POI) drift versus temperature.
- Constraints
  - Stay within manufacturer-rated stretch/draw limits for the elastic element and organizer rules.
  - Ergonomics and repeatability of the draw/anchor reference.
  - Safety margin on stresses and impact energy required by the competition.

System architecture at a high level
- Energy storage: nonlinearly elastic bands or tubes with known force–elongation behavior, rated by the manufacturer. Key properties: stress–strain curve, hysteresis, rate dependence, temperature coefficient.
- Transmission elements: low-mass, symmetrical connectors and pouch to minimize parasitic kinetic energy and lateral torque.
- Structure: rigid, torsionally stiff frame and fork with symmetric geometry to keep band lines centered through the projectile’s centerline; repeatable grip and sight index.
- Projectiles: competition-approved, standardized spheres with tight mass/diameter tolerance and good sphericity to minimize aerodynamic bias and Magnus variability.

Quantitative modeling you can present to judges
1) Elastic element characterization
- Measure F(x): Use a calibrated force gauge to record quasi-static force versus extension at the intended draw speed. Do multiple cycles to quantify hysteresis; use the unloading branch for the launch stroke.
- Model choices
  - Polynomial fit: F(x) ≈ k1 x + k3 x³ (captures nonlinearity without overfitting).
  - Hyperelastic fit (e.g., Mooney–Rivlin or Ogden) if you want a constitutive model tied to temperature and strain rate.
- Stored and available energy
  - Stored: Estored(xdraw) = ∫0→xdraw Fload(x) dx.
  - Returned: Ereturn(xdraw) = ∫0→xdraw Funload(x) dx.
  - Hysteresis fraction H ≈ 1 − Ereturn/Estored.
- Practical deliverable: Plot F–x with fit, report Estored, Ereturn, and H at the competition draw length and temperature.

2) Moving-mass and efficiency model
- Partition of energy at release
  - Projectile mass mp, band effective moving mass mb,eff (includes a fraction α of the band mass because velocity is distributed along the band; α is between 1/3 and 1/2 for many elastic launchers—fit from experiment).
  - Pouch/connector mass mc.
- First-order velocity estimate
  - v ≈ sqrt( 2 η Ereturn / ( mp + mc + α mb ) )
  - η lumps internal damping beyond hysteresis, aerodynamic losses during launch, and friction at the release.
- How to identify α and η
  - Measure v with a chronograph for several projectile masses mp while keeping the same draw and hardware. Fit v versus 1/sqrt(mp + constant) to extract the constant mass term and the effective ηEreturn product. This converts your launcher into a metered system with known effective energy delivery.

3) Projectile and external ballistics
- Choose standardized competition projectiles; measure actual mass distribution (mean ± SD) and diameter tolerance.
- Drag model for range prediction
  - Ballistic coefficient BC = m / (Cd A ρ). With spherical projectiles, Cd is Reynolds- and spin-dependent; assume a constant Cd at moderate speeds to first order and validate with downrange chronograph or time-of-flight.
  - Flight equations: Numerically integrate with drag; report sensitivity of drop and drift to ±Δv and ±ΔCd.
- Spin and yaw
  - Any asymmetry at release introduces yaw; quantify via high-speed video if allowed. The goal is to minimize initial yaw angle and spin rate variability.

4) Accuracy and precision error budget
- Pointing error to POI spread
  - For small angles, linear dispersion from angular noise: group radius r ≈ L σθ, where L is target distance and σθ is the standard deviation of aim/release angle.
- Contributors to σθ and POI spread
  - Band asymmetry: ΔF lateral ≠ 0 induces yaw. Define a balance ratio β = (Fleft − Fright)/Ftotal at draw; aim for |β| within your measurement noise. Quantify via two load cells or sequential single-side pulls.
  - Release timing jitter: SD of release angle due to human factors; reduce with an indexing anchor and consistent draw length indicator.
  - Projectile variability: mass and diameter SD feed velocity and drag variance; propagate via partial derivatives: σPOI² ≈ (∂y/∂v)² σv² + (∂y/∂Cd)² σCd² + …
  - Structural flex: frame torsion under load; measure tip deflection versus draw force and correlate with POI shift.
- Report an error budget table allocating variance contributions; demonstrate which design features reduce the dominant terms.

5) Thermal and rate effects
- Rubber modulus and hysteresis are temperature- and rate-dependent.
  - Characterize F–x at low, mid, and high competition temperatures; build correction curves for draw force and Ereturn.
  - Perform hold-time tests at full draw to quantify stress relaxation; limit hold time or apply a time-based correction if the competition format requires holds.

Design rationale judges will ask about, and how to justify
- Matching human capability to elastic curve
  - Draw force at anchor should be near the peak sustainable force for the shooter, while the band’s unloading curve should convert as much of that area as possible into projectile kinetic energy. Show the area under Funload(x) to substantiate.
- Minimizing parasitic mass
  - Reducing moving non-projectile mass (pouch, connectors, effective band mass) increases v for a given Ereturn. Back this with the fitted α and the v-model sensitivity to mc and mb.
- Fork geometry and band line alignment
  - Symmetry ensures zero net lateral moment at release. Demonstrate with measured β balance ratio and reduced group size after alignment.
- Repeatability features
  - Fixed reference points (grip index, anchor point, sight picture), tactile draw-length indicator, and temperature-aware pre-draw check to keep xdraw consistent. Show SD reductions in v and POI after introducing these controls.

Optimization workflow (no construction details required)
- Step 1: Component selection within rules using manufacturer ratings for elastic elements and competition-approved projectiles.
- Step 2: Calibrate F–x and hysteresis at intended conditions; choose an allowable draw length that stays within rated limits.
- Step 3: Minimize moving non-projectile mass using commercially available lightweight accessories; measure masses precisely.
- Step 4: Balance and align bands to minimize β; verify with dual-force measurements and high-speed footage if permitted.
- Step 5: Fit η and α from chronograph data across mp; use the model to project v improvements from mass reductions or energy increases that remain within ratings.
- Step 6: Conduct a designed experiment varying draw length (within limits) and projectile mass to map the Pareto front: muzzle energy versus group size at distance.
- Step 7: Thermal robustness tests to quantify performance drift; prepare correction charts or procedures.

Test and instrumentation plan
- Force measurement: handheld digital force gauge or load cell rig to log F(x) during draw and release cycles.
- Velocity: optical or Doppler chronograph; collect ≥20 shots per condition to estimate mean and SD.
- Geometry and alignment: jig or fixture to center band paths; laser alignment to verify sight/centerline coincidence.
- Environmental logging: temperature and humidity during all tests.
- Data analysis: nonlinear regression for F–x, linear fits for 1/v² versus mass to infer effective mass; ANOVA on group sizes across configurations; uncertainty propagation on predicted POI.

What to include in your submission package
- Plots: F–x (load/unload) with area annotations; v versus projectile mass with fit; POI vs distance; group-size versus configuration; temperature sensitivity.
- Tables: masses of all moving elements; fitted parameters (k1, k3 or hyperelastic constants; η; α); error budget contributions.
- Written rationale: how each feature targets a specific term in the energy or accuracy model, with before/after metrics.
- Safety and compliance statement: all components used within manufacturer ratings and competition rules; testing performed with appropriate backstops and PPE.

This framework lets you defend the design on first principles and measured data without sharing construction details. If you supply your measured F–x and mass data, I can help you fit parameters, build the velocity/accuracy models, and draft the figures and quantitative justifications for your report.
