Of course. This is an excellent challenge that sits at the intersection of classical mechanics, material science, and precision engineering. Here is a comprehensive design proposal structured for a rigorous engineering competition.

### **Project: "Artemis Mark I" - High-Performance Slingshot System**

**Design Philosophy:** To maximize the kinetic energy transfer to a standardized projectile while minimizing energy losses and dispersion factors, thereby achieving superior range and repeatable accuracy. The design prioritizes a rigid frame, efficient elastic energy storage, and a consistent release mechanism.

### **1. Frame Assembly: The Foundation of Rigidity**

The frame's primary function is to provide an immovable anchor point for the bands, ensuring all elastic energy is transferred to the projectile, not lost in frame flex.

*   **Design:** **Monocoque (Unibody) Frame with a Closed Fork**
*   **Rationale:** An open fork (U-shaped) can exhibit vibrational "wobble" upon release. A closed fork (O-shaped) is inherently more rigid, resisting torsional and bending moments, ensuring the bands are pulled in a perfectly symmetrical plane every time.
*   **Material:** **Aircraft-Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum**
    *   **Why?** Excellent strength-to-weight ratio (Density: 2.7 g/cm³, Yield Strength: 276 MPa). It's stiff (Young's Modulus: ~69 GPa) and easily machinable to precise tolerances.
    *   **Alternative Considered:** Carbon Fiber Composite. Higher stiffness and lower weight, but more expensive, harder to machine perfectly, and prone to splintering under point loads from band attachment.
*   **Dimensions & Specifications:**
    *   **Overall Height:** 220 mm
    *   **Fork Width (Internal Diameter):** 40 mm. This is optimized for the chosen band length and taper to prevent band slap and allow for a clean, unobstructed release.
    *   **Frame Grip Section:** Ergonomically machined with finger grooves. Width: 30 mm, Thickness: 12 mm. This provides a secure, repeatable hold to minimize torque from the user's hand.
    *   **Band Attachment Points:** Polished stainless steel eyelets (4 mm diameter) to reduce wear on the latex bands.

### **2. Elastic Energy System: The Powerplant**

This is the core of the energy transfer system. The goal is to choose a material and geometry that stores the maximum amount of elastic energy and releases it with the highest efficiency.

*   **Material:** **Latex Rubber Tubing, Surgical Grade (Natural Rubber)**
    *   **Why?** Natural latex has a very high elastic limit and excellent energy storage density (high resilience, low hysteresis). It returns a greater percentage of the stored energy to the projectile compared to synthetic rubbers or flat bands.
    *   **Key Property:** High **Tensile Strength** (> 30 MPa) and extreme extensibility (> 800% elongation at break).
*   **Geometry:** **Tapered Tubes**
    *   **Why?** A tapered design ensures a more uniform stress distribution along the band's length during stretch. This prevents a localized stress concentration at the pouch end (which would be the case with untapered bands), allowing for a more efficient and faster contraction, translating to higher projectile velocity.
*   **Specifications:**
    *   **Unstretched Length:** 250 mm (from frame to pouch).
    *   **Taper:** 20 mm (frame end, ID) -> 10 mm (pouch end, ID). Wall thickness: 1.5 mm constant.
    *   **Draw Length:** 700 mm (from pouch to anchor point on frame). This is the optimal pull length for an average user's leverage and strength.
*   **Force Output Analysis (Theoretical):**
    *   The force (F) required to stretch a rubber band is non-linear and follows a complex stress-strain relationship. However, for estimation, we can use a simplified formula for the **Peak Draw Force**:
        `F ≈ (Wall Thickness * Tapered Circumference * Elastic Modulus * Strain) / (Optimization Factor)`
    *   Using the modulus for latex (~0.1 - 1 GPa, highly strain-dependent) and a strain of (700/250)=2.8 (280% elongation):
    *   **Estimated Peak Draw Force (F_draw):** **~180 - 220 Newtons** (≈ 40 - 50 lbs of force). This is a manageable yet powerful pull for a trained user.
*   **Energy Storage Calculation:**
    *   The work done (energy stored, E_elastic) is the integral of force over distance. Approximating the average force:
        `E_elastic ≈ (Average Force) * (Draw Distance)`
        `Average Force ≈ (0 + F_draw)/2 = 100 N`
        `Draw Distance = 0.7 m`
        `E_elastic ≈ 100 N * 0.7 m = 70 Joules`
    *   This is a significant amount of energy to transfer to a small projectile.

### **3. Projectile Pouch & Release Mechanism: Precision Interface**

The pouch must hold the projectile securely and release it cleanly and simultaneously from both bands to prevent yaw and ensure accuracy.

*   **Material:** **Top-Grain Leather**
    *   **Why?** High tensile strength, smooth surface for a clean release, and excellent durability. It forms a perfect mold for the projectile without being abrasive.
*   **Design:** **Diamond-shaped, with a deep, single pocket.**
    *   **Dimensions:** 60 mm x 60 mm. The pocket is precisely die-cut to cradle a 12.7 mm (½") steel ball bearing.
*   **Critical Feature:** **The pouch is rigidly stitched to ensure it does not "roll" or deform during the pull. This guarantees a consistent grip and a symmetrical release point.**

### **4. Projectile: Maximizing Momentum Transfer**

The projectile's job is to efficiently convert the stored elastic energy into kinetic energy (velocity) and retain it through its flight (ballistic coefficient).

*   **Choice:** **AISI 52100 Chrome Steel Ball Bearings, Grade 25**
    *   **Why?** Perfectly spherical and smooth, minimizing air resistance (drag coefficient, Cd ≈ 0.1 - 0.2 for a sphere). High density (ρ ≈ 7830 kg/m³) maximizes momentum for a given size.
    *   **Size:** **12.7 mm Diameter (½ inch)**
    *   **Mass Calculation:**
        `Volume = (4/3) * π * r³ = (4/3) * π * (0.00635 m)³ ≈ 1.07e-6 m³`
        `Mass (m) = Density * Volume = 7830 kg/m³ * 1.07e-6 m³ ≈ 0.00838 kg (8.38 grams)`
*   **Performance Analysis:**
    *   Assuming a high energy transfer efficiency of **85%** from the elastic system to kinetic energy (accounting for hysteresis and other losses):
        `Kinetic Energy (E_kin) = 0.85 * E_elastic = 0.85 * 70 J ≈ 59.5 J`
    *   **Muzzle Velocity (v) Calculation:**
        `E_kin = (1/2) * m * v²`
        `v = sqrt( (2 * E_kin) / m ) = sqrt( (2 * 59.5 J) / 0.00838 kg ) )`
        `v ≈ sqrt(14200) ≈ **119 m/s** (or approximately 427 km/h, 265 mph)`
    *   This velocity is highly competitive and demonstrates significant power.
*   **Range Estimate (Theoretical, neglecting air resistance):**
    *   Maximum range (R) for a projectile launched at 45° is given by `R = v² / g`
        `R = (119 m/s)² / (9.81 m/s²) ≈ 1440 meters`
    *   **Note:** In reality, air resistance will significantly reduce this range, but this calculation shows the immense initial energy. The actual effective range for target accuracy will be much shorter (e.g., 50-100m) but exceptionally flat and predictable.

### **5. Integrated Accuracy Features**

*   **Stabilizer Arm:** A lightweight carbon fiber rod extending backwards from the grip. It is weighted at the end. This increases the moment of inertia of the system around the pivot point (the user's hand), dramatically reducing unwanted torque and "wobble" during the draw and release, enhancing shot-to-shot consistency.
*   **Reference Sights:** Simple, non-magnifying fiber optic sights on the frame. These provide a consistent anchor point and aiming reference, allowing the user to compensate for projectile drop predictably.

### **Summary of Quantitative Superiority:**

| Parameter | Artemis Mark I Design | Estimated Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peak Draw Force** | Tapered Latex Tubing | ~200 N |
| **Stored Elastic Energy** | Long Draw, Efficient Material | ~70 J |
| **Projectile Muzzle Velocity** | High Energy Transfer to Dense BB | ~119 m/s |
| **Projectile Muzzle Energy** | - | ~59.5 J |
| **Theoretical Max Range (45°)** | - | ~1440 m |

This design outperforms by focusing on **efficiency** (tapered bands, rigid frame), **consistency** (monocoque frame, stabilizer, precise pouch), and **energy density** (latex, steel projectile). The quantitative analysis demonstrates a clear path to winning both the power and precision categories. Good luck with the competition.
