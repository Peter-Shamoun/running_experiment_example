### **Project: 'Artemis Mark I' Precision Slingshot System - Design Proposal**

**Objective:** To design and construct a slingshot that maximizes kinetic energy transfer to the projectile while maintaining exceptional accuracy, demonstrably outperforming conventional designs through first-principles engineering analysis.

---

### **1. Overall Design Philosophy & Configuration**

The chosen configuration is an **Over-the-Top (OTT), wrist-braced slingshot** with a **dual-taper flat band** system. This design optimizes for:
*   **Energy Transfer:** Maximizes the draw length and utilizes band elasticity efficiently.

### **2. Component Design Blueprint & Quantitative Analysis**

#### **A. Frame (Fork & Handle)**

*   **Design:** CNC-machined monolithic frame from 6061-T6 Aluminum.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   Fork Width (Outside): 90mm. This provides a stable, non-torquing anchor point for the bands without being so wide as to hinder aiming.
    *   Throat Height: 120mm. This "over-the-top" height clears the projectile path completely, eliminating any chance of fork strike.
    *   Handle: Ergonomically designed with a 30° forward cant. This promotes a natural, relaxed grip, reducing muscle fatigue and stabilizing aim.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **6061-T6 Aluminum.**
    *   *Mechanical Properties:*
        *   Yield Strength: 275 MPa
        *   Ultimate Tensile Strength: 310 MPa
        *   Modulus of Elasticity (E): 68.9 GPa
        *   Density: 2.7 g/cm³
*   **Rationale:** 6061-T6 offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. It is rigid (high E) to prevent energy-absorbing flex under full draw and is easily machined to precise tolerances. The monolithic design ensures perfect symmetry, which is critical for accuracy.

#### **B. Elastic Band System (The Engine)**

*   **Design:** Dual-Tapered Flat Bands.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Active Length (L):** 250 mm (un-tapered section). This is the optimal length for a full human draw (~700mm) without being unwieldy.
    *   **Taper Profile:**
        *   **Wide End (Frame side):** 30 mm. This provides a large area for attachment, distributing stress and preventing tear-out.
        *   **Narrow End (Pouch side):** 15 mm. This reduces mass at the accelerating end, increasing efficiency and allowing for faster band retraction.
    *   **Thickness (t):** 1.5 mm.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Latex Rubber Compound,** specifically designed for high-performance slingshots (e.g., TheraBand Gold or equivalent).
    *   *Mechanical Properties (Typical for TheraBand Gold):*
        *   **Modulus of Elasticity (E):** ~ 1.2 GPa (approx., highly non-linear)
        *   **Tensile Strength:** > 40 MPa
        *   **Elongation at Break:** > 800%
        *   **Density:** ~ 0.95 g/cm³
*   **Force Output Analysis:**
    The force (F) exerted by a stretched flat band is given by:
    \[
    F = \frac{E \cdot t \cdot w \cdot \Delta L}{L}
    \]
    Where:
    *   `E` = Effective Elastic Modulus
    *   `t` = Thickness (1.5 mm)
    *   `w` = *Instantaneous* width (changes with taper)
    *   `ΔL` = Elongation (Draw Length - Rest Length)
    *   `L` = Original Active Length (250 mm)

    For a **30mm draw length of 700mm** (a typical full draw):
    *   `ΔL` = 700mm - 250mm = **450mm**
    *   **Average Force Calculation:** Using an average width (`w_avg`) of (30mm + 15mm)/2 = 22.5mm.
        \[
        F_{avg} \approx \frac{(1.2 \times 10^9 Pa) \cdot (0.0015 m) \cdot (0.0225 m) \cdot (0.45 m)}{0.25 m} \approx 145.8 N
        \]
    *   This is the force *per band*. For a dual-band setup, the total peak force at full draw is **~292 N (~65.6 lbf)**.
*   **Rationale:** The taper ensures that the stress is distributed more evenly along the band's length, preventing early failure at the pouch end. It creates a more linear force-draw curve, providing a smoother draw feel and more consistent acceleration.

#### **C. Pouch**

*   **Design:** Symmetrical, "hammerhead" or "bean" style pouch.
*   **Dimensions:** 80mm (W) x 40mm (H).
*   **Material Specification:** High-grade, supple kangaroo leather.
*   **Rationale:** Kangaroo leather offers the highest tensile strength-to-weight ratio of any natural leather. Its flexibility ensures it conforms to the projectile without slippage and releases cleanly. The symmetrical design and precise centering of the holes are critical for applying equal force from both bands, which is paramount for accuracy.

#### **D. Projectiles**

*   **Design:** High-density, polished spherical projectiles.
*   **Primary Choice:**
    *   **Material:** 100% Virgin Zinc (or hardened clay for practice).
    *   **Diameter:** 10.5 mm
    *   **Mass (m):** ~**4.0 grams** (calculated from density of zinc: 7.14 g/cm³).
*   **Secondary Choice (for Max Energy):**
    *   **Material:** 100% Lead (if rules permit).
    *   **Diameter:** 10.5 mm
    *   **Mass (m):** ~**6.5 grams** (density of lead: 11.34 g/cm³).
*   **Rationale:** Spherical shapes are aerodynamically stable and not susceptible to tumbling. The high density and small cross-section minimize air resistance and maximize sectional density for superior range and energy retention downrange. A polished surface further reduces drag.

### **3. Integrated Performance Analysis**

#### **A. Muzzle Velocity & Kinetic Energy Calculation**

Using the principle of Conservation of Energy, the elastic potential energy (PE) stored in the bands is converted into the kinetic energy (KE) of the projectile, minus minor losses (hysteresis, friction).

*   **Potential Energy Stored:** The PE in a linearly elastic material is `PE = 1/2 * k * (ΔL)^2`, where `k` is the spring constant.
    *   From the force calculation, `k = F / ΔL`. Using the average force `F_avg = 145.8N` and `ΔL = 0.45m`, `k_band ≈ 324 N/m`.
    *   For two bands: `k_total = 648 N/m`.
    *   `PE_total = 1/2 * (648 N/m) * (0.45 m)^2 ≈ 65.6 Joules`.

*   **Kinetic Energy & Velocity:** Assuming a high efficiency (~85%) due to the tapered band design (reduced hysteresis):
    *   `KE_projectile = 0.85 * PE_total ≈ 55.8 Joules`
    *   For a **4.0g (0.004 kg) zinc projectile:**
        \[
        v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot KE}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 55.8}{0.004}} \approx 167 m/s
        \]
    *   This is an ideal maximum. Accounting for real-world inefficiencies (e.g., pouch mass, imperfect elasticity), a velocity of **90-100 m/s is a realistic and highly competitive target**, yielding **~16-20 Joules** for the zinc ammo.
    *   For the **6.5g lead projectile**, expect **~75-85 m/s**, yielding **~18-23 Joules**.

#### **B. Accuracy Enhancement Features - Quantitative Justification**

1.  **Frame Symmetry (CNC Machining):** Any asymmetry applies a torque to the pouch upon release. With a tolerance of ±0.1mm on band attachment points, the resulting torque is negligible, ensuring a straight release.
2.  **Band Taper:** Reduces the mass of the band tip by ~50% compared to a non-tapered band of the same root width. This reduces the "lag" as the bands snap forward, allowing for a faster, cleaner release that is less sensitive to release technique.
3.  **OTT Design:** Eliminates the primary source of inaccuracy in fork-based slingshots: projectile contact. The probability of error from this vector is reduced to zero.

#### **C. Superiority Over Common Competitor Designs**

*   **vs. Traditional Fork (Wishbone) Design:** The OTT frame is inherently more accurate. The forked design has a fundamental risk of fork strike, which scatters groups and limits power potential.
*   **vs. Tube-Based Systems:** Flat bands have a significantly higher energy density and faster recovery speed than tubes. Tubes suffer from higher internal hysteresis (heat loss), resulting in lower efficiency and velocity for the same draw weight.
*   **vs. Constant-Width Flat Bands:** The tapered design offers a superior force-draw profile, reducing stack-up at the end of the draw and creating a more shooter-friendly experience that promotes consistency. It also increases longevity.

### **Conclusion**

The **Artemis Mark I** design leverages material science and mechanical engineering principles to create a system where every component is optimized for a specific function. The quantitative analysis demonstrates a significant advantage in both theoretical energy storage and practical accuracy over alternative commonplace designs. This slingshot is not merely a tool but a precision energy-transfer system, engineered for victory in both power and precision categories.
