Of course. This is an excellent challenge that sits at the intersection of classical mechanics, material science, and engineering design. Here is a comprehensive design proposal tailored for a rigorous academic competition.

### **Project: "Artemis Mark I" - High-Performance Slingshot System**

#### **1. Design Philosophy & Core Principles**

The primary objective is to maximize the kinetic energy transferred to the projectile while ensuring its release is consistent and predictable for accuracy. This is governed by two equations:

1.  **Energy Transfer:** The kinetic energy (`KE`) of the projectile is equal to the elastic potential energy (`PE_elastic`) stored in the bands at full draw, minus system losses (hysteresis, friction).
    `KE_projectile = PE_elastic = (1/2) * k_effective * (Δx)^2`
    Where `k_effective` is the effective spring constant of the band system and `Δx` is the draw length.

2.  **Impulse and Force:** The launch is an impulse event. The average force `F_avg` applied over the time `Δt` of acceleration determines the final velocity (`v`).
    `F_avg * Δt = m * v`
    A quicker, more forceful impulse yields higher velocity.

Therefore, the design optimizes for:
*   **High `Δx` (Draw Length):** To maximize the `(Δx)^2` term.
*   **High `k_effective` (Band Force):** Through material selection and band geometry.
*   **Minimized Mass:** Of the pouch and non-essential frame parts to reduce energy loss.
*   **Perfect Release Consistency:** To ensure the projectile's path is solely determined by the aiming solution.

#### **2. Component Specification & Quantitative Analysis**

**A. Frame (The "Chassis")**

*   **Material:** **6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**.
    *   *Rationale:* Excellent strength-to-weight ratio (Tensile Yield Strength: ~275 MPa, Density: 2.7 g/cm³). It is stiff (Young's Modulus: ~69 GPa) to prevent frame flex, which absorbs energy and introduces aiming variance. Easily machinable for precise feature creation.
*   **Design:** **Over-the-Top (OTT), Mono-Fork Design**.
    *   *Rationale:* The OTT configuration ensures the bands are pre-stretched even at rest, reducing the "dead zone" at the start of the draw and making the force curve more linear. The mono-fork (single upright) minimizes weight and provides an unobstructed sight picture for aiming.
*   **Critical Dimensions:**
    *   **Fork Width (Tip):** 22 mm. Narrow enough to allow a clean band attachment but wide enough to prevent stress concentration.
    *   **Fork Height:** 120 mm from the pivot point of the bands. This height is calculated to allow for a **300 mm (12") draw length** without the pouch reaching the frame, ensuring safety and a full power stroke.
    *   **Handle:** Ergonomically designed with a 35mm diameter and contoured grooves to lock the hand into a repeatable, torque-free grip.

**B. Elastic System (The "Engine")**

*   **Material:** **Natural Latex Rubber Tubing**, Flat Band cut from sheet.
    *   *Rationale:* Latex has superior elastic properties with high energy return (low hysteresis—~90-95% energy return) compared to synthetic rubbers. Flat bands offer a larger surface area against the pouch, leading to a cleaner, more consistent release than tubes.
*   **Specification:** **Tapered Flat Bands**.
    *   *Dimensions:* Un-tapered dimensions: 20 mm wide, 0.8 mm thick.
    *   *Taper Ratio:* 3:1 taper (e.g., 20 mm at the frame attachment tapering to ~6.7 mm at the pouch). This optimizes the force curve. The thick, wide end attached to the frame bears the highest stress, while the thinner, narrow tip accelerates the pouch more efficiently at the end of the draw, delivering a snappier impulse.
*   **Mechanical Properties & Force Calculation:**
    *   Assume a measured **Spring Constant (`k`) for the un-tapered material** of **25 N/m per mm of length** (a typical value for high-quality latex of this thickness). This is a critical measured value.
    *   For a **total active band length** of 200 mm per side:
        *   The effective `k` for a double bandset is `k_total = 2 * (25 N/m) / 0.2 m = 250 N/m`. (Calculation: `k` per side = `k_per_meter / length`; then doubled).
    *   **Force at Full Draw (F):** Using Hooke's Law, `F = k_total * Δx`.
        *   For our **Δx = 0.3 m (300 mm) draw**, `F = 250 N/m * 0.3 m = 75 N` (~16.9 lbf).
    *   This is the force the user must hold. This is a safe but effective level for an adult operator.

**C. Pouch (The "Release Mechanism")**

*   **Material:** **Premium Suede Leather**.
    *   *Rationale:* High coefficient of friction to prevent premature projectile slippage, yet smooth enough to ensure a clean, instantaneous release. It is durable and flexible.
*   **Design:** **Diamond Shape with Rolled Edges**.
    *   *Dimensions:* 30 mm x 50 mm. This size perfectly cradles the projectiles without being excessively heavy.
    *   *Rationale:* The diamond shape and rolled edges guide the bands to center upon acceleration, promoting a symmetrical and consistent release critical for accuracy. Mass is minimized to under 3 grams.

**D. Projectiles (The "Payload")**

*   **Primary Caliber:** **9.5mm (.375 inch) Steel Ball Bearings (Grade 25)**.
    *   *Rationale:* Superior density (~7.8 g/cm³) and perfect sphericity. Density maximizes sectional density for better energy retention downrange against air resistance. Perfect sphericity eliminates aerodynamic irregularities, making trajectory predictable.
    *   *Mass:* `m = Volume * Density = (4/3 * π * (0.475cm)^3) * 7.8 g/cm³ ≈ 3.5 grams`.
*   **Alternative Caliber (for different assessments):** **8mm Clay Ammo**.
    *   *Rationale:* For accuracy courses where safety or target marking is a concern. Lighter weight (~1.6 g) will yield higher velocity but much lower kinetic energy and greater wind drift.

#### **3. Performance Simulation & Numerical Superiority**

**A. Kinetic Energy & Muzzle Velocity Calculation:**

The elastic potential energy at full draw is:
`PE_elastic = (1/2) * k_total * (Δx)^2 = (1/2) * 250 N/m * (0.3 m)^2 = 11.25 Joules`

Assuming a high **90% energy transfer efficiency** (achievable with good latex and a light pouch), the kinetic energy imparted to the projectile is:
`KE = 0.90 * 11.25 J = 10.125 J`

The velocity (`v`) of a 3.5g steel bearing is derived from `KE = (1/2) * m * v^2`:
`v = sqrt( (2 * KE) / m ) = sqrt( (2 * 10.125 J) / 0.0035 kg ) ) ≈ 76.1 m/s (≈ 250 fps)`

This velocity is highly competitive for a hand-held slingshot. For a 1.6g clay projectile, the velocity would be **~112 m/s**, but the KE would be only **~10 J**, demonstrating the steel shot's superior energy delivery.

**B. Accuracy Analysis: Key Features**

1.  **Band-Centering Pouch:** The diamond pouch ensures symmetrical force application, preventing projectile yaw at launch.
2.  **Mono-Fork Sight Picture:** Provides an completely unobstructed view of the target, allowing for precise optical alignment. The fork tip can be used as a front sight.
3.  **Consistent Draw Length:** A simple **physical draw stop** (e.g., a knot on the bands) will be integrated to ensure every draw is exactly 300 mm. This makes the `Δx` and therefore the `PE_elastic` perfectly repeatable, which is the foundation of accuracy.
4.  **Frame Rigidity:** The 6061-T6 aluminum frame, with its high stiffness, ensures the fork alignment remains constant shot-to-shot, preventing zero drift.

**C. Comparative Advantage Summary**

*   **Energy:** The tapered band system delivers ~10 J to the projectile, a figure that will outperform any design using shorter draws, non-tapered bands, or inferior rubber.
*   **Accuracy:** The combination of the OTT/mono-fork design, band-centering pouch, and draw stop creates a system with minimal variables, translating to superior repeatability and grouping.
*   **Engineering Rigor:** Every component choice is justified by quantifiable material properties (Young's Modulus, Tensile Strength, Density) and physics principles (Hooke's Law, Energy Conservation, Impulse).

This design provides a blueprint for a slingshot that is not merely powerful, but is a precision instrument, demonstrably optimized through engineering analysis.
