### **Design Proposal: The "Momentum" High-Performance Slingshot**

**Submitted for the University Engineering Society Slingshot Design Competition**

**Design Philosophy:** The "Momentum" slingshot is engineered from first principles to maximize the conversion of stored elastic potential energy into projectile kinetic energy while ensuring a stable, repeatable launch platform for unparalleled precision. The design prioritizes:
1.  **Maximizing Stored Potential Energy:** Achieved through a long draw length and high-performance latex bands.
2.  **Optimizing Energy Conversion Efficiency:** Minimized through the use of lightweight, low-hysteresis components and a tapered band design that optimizes velocity transfer.
3.  **Ensuring Launch Stability and Repeatability:** Realized through an ergonomic, rigid frame, an integrated arm brace to counteract torque, and a precision sighting system to minimize human error.

### **1.0 Component Design & Quantitative Analysis**

#### **1.1 Frame (Yoke)**
The frame serves as the structural backbone, resisting the high tensile forces of the bands without flex or failure.

*   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT). This aligns the sight picture directly over the bands, creating a more intuitive and less complex aiming plane, reducing parallax error compared to Through-The-Fork (TTF) designs.
*   **Material:** **7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy.**
    *   **Yield Strength (σ_y):** ~503 MPa
    *   **Young's Modulus (E):** 71.7 GPa
    *   **Density (ρ):** 2.81 g/cm³
*   **Rationale:** 7075-T6 offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring absolute rigidity under load. Its high Young's Modulus prevents flex during the draw, which would otherwise dissipate energy and compromise accuracy.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Fork Width (Outer):** 95 mm
    *   **Fork Gap (Inner):** 50 mm (Provides ample clearance for the projectile and pouch, preventing "fork hits")
    *   **Fork Tip Cross-Section:** 15 mm x 10 mm (Rectangular profile for strength)
    *   **Handle Length:** 120 mm, ergonomically contoured.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Structural Integrity):**
    *   **Estimated Max Band Tension (F_max):** 150 N per side (Total 300 N, see Section 1.2).
    *   **Analysis Model:** We model a single fork arm as a cantilever beam of length L = 60 mm (from handle to tip) subjected to the force F_max.
    *   **Maximum Bending Moment (M_max):** M = F * L = 150 N * 0.060 m = 9.0 Nm.
    *   **Moment of Inertia (I) for rectangular cross-section:** I = (base * height³) / 12 = (0.010 m * (0.015 m)³) / 12 = 2.81 x 10⁻⁹ m⁴.
    *   **Maximum Bending Stress (σ_max):** σ = (M * c) / I, where c is the distance from the neutral axis (7.5 mm).
        *   σ_max = (9.0 Nm * 0.0075 m) / (2.81 x 10⁻⁹ m⁴) = **24.0 MPa**.
    *   **Safety Factor (SF):** SF = Yield Strength / Max Stress = 503 MPa / 24.0 MPa = **21.0**.
    *   **Conclusion:** The design incorporates a safety factor of over 20, guaranteeing zero plastic deformation and negligible elastic flex, ensuring every shot is mechanically identical.

#### **1.2 Elastic Bands (Power Generation System)**
This is the heart of the slingshot's power system.

*   **Material:** **TheraBand Gold™ Latex Sheeting.**
    *   **Known for:** High retraction velocity and relatively low hysteresis (~15-20% energy loss per cycle).
*   **Configuration:** **Tapered Cut.**
    *   **Dimensions:** 25 mm (at fork) tapering to 20 mm (at pouch) over an active length of 200 mm.
*   **Rationale:** A tapered band configuration is critical for performance. The wider, more massive section at the fork remains relatively stationary while the lighter, narrower end at the pouch accelerates to a much higher velocity. This "whipping" action more efficiently transfers energy to the projectile than a straight-cut band of equivalent draw weight.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Energy Storage):**
    *   **Draw Length (x):** 80 cm (0.8 m). This corresponds to a 400% elongation of the 20 cm active band length.
    *   **Force-Draw Curve:** For simplification, we model the force as linear (Hooke's Law: F = kx), which is a reasonable approximation for this elongation range.
    *   **Estimated Max Draw Force (F_max):** Based on empirical data for this bandset, F_max ≈ 150 N.
    *   **Spring Constant (k):** k = F / x = 150 N / 0.8 m = 187.5 N/m.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (PE_stored):** PE = ½kx²
        *   PE = 0.5 * (187.5 N/m) * (0.8 m)² = **60.0 Joules**.
    *   **Conclusion:** This band configuration is designed to store a significant 60 J of potential energy, the primary determinant of the slingshot's power.

#### **1.3 Pouch**
The interface between the bands and projectile. Its design is critical for a clean release and energy efficiency.

*   **Material:** **Dyneema (UHMWPE) Fiber Composite Fabric.**
    *   **Rationale:** Dyneema offers unparalleled tensile strength at an extremely low mass, minimizing parasitic energy loss. Its slick surface ensures a clean, low-friction release of the projectile.
*   **Dimensions:** 60 mm x 22 mm.
*   **Mass (m_pouch):** **0.8 grams.**
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Parasitic Mass):** The energy invested in accelerating the pouch is wasted energy. Minimizing pouch mass is paramount. The effect of the band's mass can be approximated by adding an "effective mass" (typically 1/3 of the total band mass) to the pouch mass.
    *   **Band Mass (m_bands):** Approx. 5.0 g.
    *   **Total Parasitic Mass (m_parasitic):** m_pouch + (m_bands / 3) = 0.8 g + (5.0 g / 3) ≈ **2.5 grams**.
    *   This analysis directly informs the energy transfer model in Section 2.1.

#### **1.4 Arm Brace**
This component transforms the user's arm from a weak pivot (the wrist) into a stable, cantilevered platform.

*   **Material:** **Carbon Fiber Composite.**
    *   **Rationale:** Maximum stiffness-to-weight ratio. The brace must resist bending and torsional forces without adding excessive weight.
*   **Function:** Creates a third point of contact on the forearm, effectively lengthening the lever arm that counteracts the torque generated by the draw force.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Stability):**
    *   **Torque at Wrist (T_wrist):** T = F_draw * d, where d is the distance from the grip center to the fork tips (~8 cm).
    *   T_wrist = 150 N * 0.08 m = 12 Nm.
    *   Without a brace, this 12 Nm torque must be counteracted solely by the user's wrist muscles, introducing fatigue and tremor. The arm brace transfers this load to the larger, more stable muscles of the forearm, distributing the force over a ~20 cm contact area. This reduces angular deviation (wobble) at the moment of release by an estimated 80-90%, directly increasing precision.

#### **1.5 Sighting System**
To achieve precision, a repeatable aiming reference is non-negotiable.

*   **Type:** **Adjustable Single-Pin Fiber Optic Sight.**
    *   **Rationale:** Borrowed from modern archery, a fiber optic pin provides a bright, clear aiming point that is easily picked up by the eye. The sight is mounted on a calibrated rail, allowing for precise vertical adjustment to compensate for projectile drop at different ranges ("dialing for distance").
*   **Analysis:** This system removes the guesswork of "instinctive" aiming. By providing a fixed mechanical reference, it isolates aiming variability, allowing the user to focus solely on a consistent anchor point and release. The ability to precisely adjust for elevation is critical for scoring high in a multi-distance accuracy assessment.

#### **1.6 Projectile**
The projectile's characteristics are as important as the launcher's.

*   **Type:** **9.5 mm (3/8") Grade 100 Hardened Steel Ball Bearing.**
*   **Material:** **AISI 52100 Chrome Steel.**
    *   **Density (ρ):** 7.85 g/cm³
*   **Quantitative Analysis:**
    *   **Radius (r):** 4.75 mm (0.00475 m).
    *   **Volume (V):** V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(0.00475 m)³ = 4.49 x 10⁻⁷ m³.
    *   **Mass (m_proj):** m = ρ * V = (7850 kg/m³) * (4.49 x 10⁻⁷ m³) = 0.00352 kg = **3.52 grams.**
    *   **Sectional Density:** This is a key metric for ballistic performance. A sphere's sectional density is proportional to its mass divided by its cross-sectional area (m/A). High sectional density minimizes the deceleration caused by atmospheric drag. Steel provides a very high mass for its volume, maximizing this property.
    *   **Consistency:** Using Grade 100 ball bearings guarantees mass and sphericity are consistent to within micrograms and micrometers, respectively, eliminating projectile variation as a source of error.

### **2.0 Integrated Performance & Energy Transfer Analysis**

This section synthesizes the component analyses to predict overall system performance.

#### **2.1 Energy Transfer Model**
1.  **Stored Potential Energy (PE_stored):** **60.0 J** (from Section 1.2).
2.  **Energy Losses:**
    *   **Band Hysteresis (Loss_hys):** Estimated at 18% for high-quality latex.
        *   Loss_hys = 60.0 J * 0.18 = **10.8 J**.
    *   **Kinetic Energy of Moving Parts (KE_parasitic):** Energy required to accelerate the pouch and bands.
        *   Energy available after hysteresis: E_avail = 60.0 J - 10.8 J = 49.2 J.
        *   This available energy is partitioned between the projectile and the parasitic mass.
        *   m_proj = 3.52 g; m_parasitic = 2.5 g.
        *   KE_proj = E_avail * [m_proj / (m_proj + m_parasitic)]
        *   KE_proj = 49.2 J * [3.52 / (3.52 + 2.5)] = 49.2 J * 0.585 = **28.8 J**.
        *   The remaining **20.4 J** is lost as KE_parasitic.
3.  **Final Projectile Kinetic Energy (KE_proj):** **28.8 Joules.**

#### **2.2 Muzzle Velocity Estimation**
Using the final projectile kinetic energy, we can calculate the theoretical muzzle velocity (v).

*   **Formula:** KE = ½mv² => v = √(2 * KE / m)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   v = √(2 * 28.8 J / 0.00352 kg)
    *   v = √(16363)
    *   **v ≈ 128 m/s (or 420 ft/s)**

#### **2.3 Overall System Efficiency (η)**
Efficiency is the ratio of useful output energy (KE_proj) to input energy (PE_stored).

*   **η = KE_proj / PE_stored**
*   η = 28.8 J / 60.0 J = **48%**
*   **Conclusion:** This design achieves a very high efficiency of 48%. Competing designs using heavier pouches, non-tapered bands, or flexible frames will exhibit significantly lower efficiencies, likely in the 30-35% range, resulting in lower projectile velocity from the same draw force.
