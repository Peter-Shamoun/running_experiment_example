### **Project Artemis: A High-Performance Slingshot for Maximized Energy Transfer and Precision**

**Design Proposal for the University Engineering Society Slingshot Competition**

### **1.0 Abstract**

Project Artemis is a slingshot system engineered from first principles to achieve maximum muzzle energy and repeatable sub-degree accuracy. The design philosophy is centered on three core objectives: (1) Maximizing the storage of elastic potential energy, (2) Optimizing the efficiency of energy transfer from the elastic bands to the projectile, and (3) Minimizing user-induced error through a stable, ergonomic, and precisely aimable platform. This proposal details the quantitative analysis of the frame, power system, and projectiles, forecasting a muzzle energy of over 25 Joules with a 9.5mm lead projectile, representing a significant performance increase over conventional designs.

### **2.0 Overall Design Philosophy**

The efficacy of a slingshot is governed by the expression for kinetic energy: **KE = ½ * m * v²**. Our design systematically optimizes every variable that contributes to maximizing the projectile's exit velocity (v).

*   **Energy Storage (Potential Energy, PE):** The system is designed to store the maximum possible elastic potential energy, approximated by **PE = ½ * k * x²**, where *k* is the effective spring constant of the bands and *x* is the draw length.
*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** The conversion of PE to KE is never 100%. Our design minimizes energy losses due to:
    *   **Hysteresis:** Internal friction in the elastic material.
    *   **Parasitic Mass:** Energy wasted accelerating the bands and pouch.
    *   **Frame Deformation:** Energy absorbed by the flexing of the frame.
    *   **Aerodynamic Drag:** On the bands and pouch during contraction.
*   **Precision:** The design incorporates features to ensure shot-to-shot consistency, minimizing angular deviation and enabling predictable projectile trajectory.

### **3.0 Component-Level Design and Analysis**

#### **3.1 Frame (Chassis)**

The frame is the foundation of the system, providing stability and a consistent anchor for the power system.

*   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT) Fork with an Integrated Wrist Brace.
    *   **Rationale:** An OTT configuration aligns the force vector of the bands directly over the user's gripping hand. This minimizes the "fork-slap" phenomenon and reduces the vertical torque that can disrupt aim during release, a common issue in Through-The-Fork (TTF) designs. The wrist brace acts as a moment arm, effectively counteracting the remaining torque from the draw force, drastically increasing stability and allowing for the use of more powerful bands without compromising control.
*   **Material Specification:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Yield Strength (σ_y):** ~503 MPa
        *   **Young's Modulus (E):** 71.7 GPa
        *   **Density (ρ):** 2.81 g/cm³
    *   **Rationale:** 7075-T6 offers a superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to steel, polymers, or lower-grade aluminum. Its high yield strength ensures minimal frame flex under high draw forces, preventing energy loss and maintaining a consistent aiming platform. Its rigidity (high Young's Modulus) is critical for repeatability.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Fork Width (outside):** 90 mm
    *   **Fork Gap (inside):** 50 mm
    *   **Fork Height:** 130 mm
    *   **Fork Cross-section:** 20 mm x 10 mm (elliptical for strength)
    *   **Grip:** Ergonomically contoured, 110 mm length, 30 mm average diameter.
    *   **Wrist Brace Length:** 150 mm from base of grip.

*   **Quantitative Analysis (Stress Analysis):**
    *   **Assumption:** The maximum draw force from the bands is estimated at 150 N (see Section 3.2). Each fork arm supports half this force, F = 75 N.
    *   **Model:** Each fork arm is modeled as a cantilever beam of length L = 130 mm, fixed at the grip.
    *   **Bending Moment (M):** M = F * L = 75 N * 0.130 m = 9.75 Nm.
    *   **Area Moment of Inertia (I):** For a 20x10mm rectangular cross-section (approximation): I = (base * height³) / 12 = (0.010 * 0.020³) / 12 ≈ 6.67 x 10⁻⁹ m⁴.
    *   **Maximum Bending Stress (σ_max):** σ_max = (M * c) / I, where c is the distance from the neutral axis (c = 10 mm = 0.010 m).
        σ_max = (9.75 Nm * 0.010 m) / (6.67 x 10⁻⁹ m⁴) ≈ **14.6 MPa**.
    *   **Factor of Safety (FoS):** FoS = σ_y / σ_max = 503 MPa / 14.6 MPa ≈ **34.4**.
    *   **Conclusion:** The FoS is exceptionally high, confirming that frame flex will be negligible, ensuring virtually all stored energy is available for transfer to the projectile.

#### **3.2 Elastic Power System (Bands and Pouch)**

This is the engine of the slingshot. Its design is critical for power generation and efficiency.

*   **Material Specification:** Premium Shear-Tapered Latex (e.g., TheraBand Gold or specialized slingshot latex).
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Elongation at Break:** >600%
        *   **Hysteresis Loss:** ~10-15% (energy lost as heat per cycle)
    *   **Rationale:** Latex offers the best combination of high elongation and low hysteresis among common elastomers.
*   **Configuration:** Tapered Bands.
    *   **Dimensions:**
        *   **Fork End Width:** 25 mm
        *   **Pouch End Width:** 15 mm
        *   **Active Length (unstretched):** 180 mm (optimized for a standard 80 cm draw length).
    *   **Rationale:** Tapering the bands is the single most important innovation for velocity. The wider section at the fork anchors the force, while the narrower, lighter end at the pouch accelerates more rapidly. This creates a "whip effect," where the band tip's contraction velocity exceeds that of a non-tapered band of equivalent draw weight, significantly increasing projectile speed.

*   **Quantitative Analysis (Energy Storage):**
    *   **Assumption:** The force-draw curve of latex is nearly linear up to 400% elongation. We can approximate it using Hooke's Law.
    *   **Draw Length (x):** 80 cm (0.8 m).
    *   **Elongation:** (80 cm) / (18 cm) ≈ 444%.
    *   **Force Measurement (Empirical Data for this Taper):** A 25-15mm taper of this latex typically produces a draw force of ~150 N at an 80 cm draw.
    *   **Effective Spring Constant (k):** k = F / x = 150 N / 0.8 m = **187.5 N/m**.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (PE):** PE = ½ * k * x² = 0.5 * 187.5 N/m * (0.8 m)² = **60 Joules**.

#### **3.3 Pouch**

The interface between the power system and the projectile. Its design impacts release consistency and energy efficiency.

*   **Material Specification:** Laminated "Super-Pouch" construction.
    *   **Outer Layer:** Kangaroo Leather (High tensile strength, low stretch).
    *   **Inner Layer:** Microfiber cloth (Securely grips projectile).
*   **Design:**
    *   **Dimensions:** 55 mm x 18 mm.
    *   **Mass:** Target mass < 0.8 grams.
    *   **Features:** A 3mm center hole for consistent projectile seating and alignment.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Parasitic Mass):**
    *   **Rationale:** The pouch is accelerated along with the projectile, consuming a portion of the stored energy. Minimizing its mass is critical.
    *   **Parasitic Energy Loss (Estimate):** Assuming the pouch and band tips have an "effective mass" of one-third their actual mass, the total parasitic mass (m_p) is ~2.0 g. The energy wasted is KE_p = ½ * m_p * v². This will be factored into the overall efficiency calculation.

#### **3.4 Aiming System**

*   **Configuration:** Adjustable Fiber Optic Sights.
    *   **Rationale:** A simple notch or frame edge is imprecise. Fiber optic pins provide a bright, clear aiming point that is easily referenced against the target in various lighting conditions.
    *   **Features:** The sight is mounted on a rail, allowing for calibrated adjustments for elevation (range) and windage. This transforms the slingshot from an intuitive weapon to a precision instrument.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Angular Precision):**
    *   **Scenario:** An aiming error of just 1 mm at the sight, held at an arm's length of 70 cm (0.7 m) from the eye.
    *   **Angular Error (θ):** θ = arctan(error / distance) = arctan(0.001 m / 0.7 m) ≈ 0.00143 radians or 0.082 degrees.
    *   **Miss Distance at 20 meters:** Miss = tan(θ) * 20 m ≈ **2.86 cm**.
    *   **Conclusion:** This demonstrates that even a minute aiming inconsistency leads to significant misses at range. A precise, adjustable sight is non-negotiable for a competition-grade design.

### **4.0 Projectile Design and Performance Projection**

#### **4.1 Projectile Specification**

*   **Material:** Lead (Pb).
    *   **Density (ρ):** 11.34 g/cm³.
    *   **Rationale:** Lead's high density maximizes mass for a given diameter. A higher mass projectile has a higher ballistic coefficient, retaining velocity and energy more effectively over distance and being less affected by crosswinds.
*   **Shape:** Sphere.
    *   **Rationale:** A sphere offers predictable and consistent aerodynamic properties (Drag Coefficient, Cd ≈ 0.47 in subsonic flow) and ensures perfect, repeatable seating in the pouch.
*   **Dimensions:** 9.5 mm (3/8 inch) diameter.
    *   **Volume (V):** V = (4/3) * π * r³ = (4/3) * π * (0.00475 m)³ ≈ 4.49 x 10⁻⁷ m³.
    *   **Mass (m):** m = ρ * V = 11,340 kg/m³ * 4.49 x 10⁻⁷ m³ ≈ **0.0051 kg (5.1 grams)**.

#### **4.2 Performance Projections**

*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):**
    *   **Stored PE:** 60 J.
    *   **Losses:**
        *   Latex Hysteresis: ~15% (9.0 J)
        *   Parasitic Mass Acceleration: ~5% (3.0 J)
        *   Aerodynamic Drag (Bands): ~2% (1.2 J)
        *   Frame/Hand Absorption: <1% (negligible due to rigid design)
    *   **Total Estimated Loss:** ~22%
    *   **Overall Efficiency (η):** ~78%.
*   **Muzzle Energy (KE):**
    *   KE = PE_stored * η = 60 J * 0.78 = **46.8 Joules**.
    *   *Note: This is an optimistic theoretical maximum. A more conservative η of 60-70% is common. We will use a conservative **η = 65%** for the final projection.*
    *   **Projected Muzzle Energy (KE):** 60 J * 0.65 = **39 Joules**.
*   **Muzzle Velocity (v):**
    *   v = √(2 * KE / m) = √(2 * 39 J / 0.0051 kg) ≈ **123.7 m/s (406 ft/s)**.

### **6.0 Conclusion**

Project Artemis represents a systematic, physics-based approach to slingshot design. By optimizing each component—from the high-modulus 7075-T6 frame that eliminates energy-wasting flex, to the shear-tapered latex bands that maximize contraction velocity, to the high-density lead projectile that retains energy—the design achieves a projected muzzle energy and velocity far exceeding conventional models. The quantitative analyses confirm the structural integrity and energy storage capacity, while the inclusion of a precision aiming system addresses the critical factor of accuracy. This design is not merely an assembly of parts but an integrated system engineered for a single purpose: to win this competition through superior power and precision.
