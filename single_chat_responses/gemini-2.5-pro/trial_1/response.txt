### **Project "Artemis": A High-Performance Competition Slingshot Design Proposal**

**Prepared for:** The University Engineering Society Design Competition
**Objective:** To present a slingshot design, "Project Artemis," engineered for maximum power, precision, and energy efficiency, supported by quantitative analysis.

---

### **1.0 Design Philosophy & Core Principles**

The Artemis design is founded on three core engineering principles:

1.  **Maximization of Stored Potential Energy:** The system is designed to store the maximum possible elastic potential energy within the ergonomic limits of a human operator. This is achieved through material selection and the geometric configuration of the elastic bands.
2.  **Optimization of Energy Transfer Efficiency:** Every component is engineered to minimize parasitic mass and energy loss during the transfer from potential energy in the bands to kinetic energy in the projectile. The design seeks to approach the theoretical maximum energy transfer efficiency for the chosen projectile mass.
3.  **Enhancement of System Stability & Repeatability:** The frame geometry, aiming system, and ergonomic features are designed to minimize shooter-induced error, ensuring that the slingshot's mechanical potential is translated into consistent, accurate shots.

### **2.0 Component Analysis and Specifications**

#### **2.1 Frame (Yoke & Handle)**

The frame serves as the structural backbone, transferring the draw force to the user's stabilizing arm and providing a consistent aiming platform.

*   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT) Fork Design.
    *   **Rationale:** An OTT configuration aligns the bands' line of force directly over the top of the forks. This minimizes the vertical torque that can occur with Through-The-Fork (TTF) designs, resulting in a cleaner release and a more intuitive, "point-and-shoot" aiming picture. It simplifies the aiming plane to a single vertical axis.
*   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy Billet.
    *   **Rationale:** This material provides an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, crucial for a rigid, non-flexing frame that remains manageable.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Yield Strength:** ~503 MPa. This ensures the frame will not permanently deform under the high tensile loads of the drawn bands (>500 N).
        *   **Young's Modulus (Stiffness):** 71.7 GPa. The high modulus prevents frame flex during the draw and release, a critical factor for accuracy. A flexing frame would absorb energy and introduce shot-to-shot inconsistency.
        *   **Density:** 2.81 g/cm³. Allows for a robust frame without excessive mass.
*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Fork Width (Outer):** 95 mm. A wider fork allows for a longer power stroke before the bands collide and enables the use of wider bands for more power.
    *   **Fork Gap:** 50 mm. Provides a clear sight picture without being excessively wide, which could induce horizontal aiming errors.
    *   **Fork Tips:** Rounded, 22.5 mm width. Features a 1 mm chamfer and groove for secure band attachment via the "wrap-and-tuck" method, which is secure and low-profile.
    *   **Handle Length:** 125 mm. Ergonomically designed to fit the 95th percentile male hand, with a "pistol grip" contour for repeatable hand placement.
*   **Performance Feature: Integrated Stabilizing Brace**
    *   **Description:** A rigid arm brace, also made from 7075-T6 aluminum, extends from the base of the handle and cuffs around the user's forearm.
    *   **Rationale:** The brace distributes the recoil force over the entire forearm, drastically increasing stability. This minimizes wrist tremble and allows the user to handle a significantly higher draw weight (~30-40% increase) with greater control, directly translating to higher potential energy storage and improved precision.

#### **2.2 Elastic System (Power Bands)**

This is the engine of the slingshot. The design focuses on maximizing contraction velocity and energy density.

*   **Material:** TheraBand Gold™ Latex Sheeting.
    *   **Rationale:** This material is the industry standard for high-performance slingshots due to its high elongation factor (~600%), rapid contraction speed, and excellent durability.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Energy Storage Density:** Approximately 150-200 kJ/m³. Superior to most other elastomers.
        *   **Contraction Velocity (Unloaded):** >130 m/s. This high speed is critical for transferring energy to the projectile efficiently.
*   **Configuration:** Tapered Flat Bands.
    *   **Rationale:** A tapered cut (wider at the fork, narrower at the pouch) is the single most important feature for maximizing projectile velocity. As the band retracts, the portion near the pouch must accelerate to a higher velocity than the portion at the stationary fork. By reducing the mass of the faster-moving sections (the tapered end), we significantly increase the overall contraction velocity. This is analogous to the "whip-crack" effect.
*   **Dimensions & Quantitative Analysis:**
    *   **Taper:** 25 mm (at fork) to 20 mm (at pouch).
    *   **Thickness:** 0.75 mm.
    *   **Active Length (unstretched):** 18 cm.
    *   **Draw Length (x):** 72 cm (from 18 cm active length to 90 cm full draw). This represents a 400% elongation (5x original length).
    *   **Force & Energy Calculation:**
        *   The force-draw curve for latex is non-linear. However, for analysis, we can approximate it with an effective spring constant (k). Based on empirical data for this bandset configuration, the draw weight at 90 cm is approximately **140 Newtons (~31.5 lbf)**.
        *   The stored potential energy (PE) is the integral of the Force-Draw curve, which can be approximated as PE ≈ ½ * F_max * x.
        *   **PE ≈ 0.5 * 140 N * 0.72 m = 50.4 Joules**
        *   This value of **50.4 J** represents the total stored elastic potential energy available for transfer to the projectile.

#### **2.3 Pouch**

The pouch is a critical interface component, and its mass is a primary source of parasitic energy loss.

*   **Material:** Multi-layer Dyneema® Composite Fabric (DCF).
    *   **Rationale:** DCF offers the highest tensile strength-to-weight ratio of any commercially available fabric. It is ultra-lightweight, has near-zero stretch (ensuring a crisp, simultaneous release from both bands), and is highly resistant to abrasion.
*   **Dimensions:** 55 mm x 22 mm.
*   **Mass:** Approximately **0.8 grams**.
*   **Rationale for Low Mass:** Minimizing pouch mass is essential for maximizing energy transfer efficiency. Every gram of pouch mass is parasitic mass that is accelerated along with the projectile but does not contribute to the final kinetic energy of the payload.

### **3.0 Projectile Analysis and System Efficiency**

The choice of projectile is as critical as the slingshot itself. The design must be matched to the projectile for optimal performance.

*   **Material:** 10mm Diameter Steel Ball Bearing.
    *   **Rationale:** Steel provides high density, ensuring a high sectional density and ballistic coefficient. The spherical shape offers predictable and consistent aerodynamic performance regardless of its orientation upon release.
    *   **Properties:**
        *   **Diameter:** 10.0 mm (0.01 m)
        *   **Density (ρ):** ~7850 kg/m³
        *   **Volume (V):** (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(0.005 m)³ ≈ 5.236 x 10⁻⁷ m³
        *   **Mass (M):** ρ * V = 7850 kg/m³ * 5.236 x 10⁻⁷ m³ ≈ **4.11 grams (0.00411 kg)**

*   **Quantitative Analysis of Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):**
    *   The efficiency of energy transfer from the bands to the projectile is governed by the formula: **η = M / (M + m_eff)**
        *   **M:** Mass of the projectile (0.00411 kg).
        *   **m_eff:** Effective mass of the elastic system. This is the portion of the band and pouch mass that contributes to the system's inertia. A widely accepted approximation is **m_eff = (Mass of Pouch) + (Mass of Bands / 3)**.
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   Mass of one band (L*W_avg*T*ρ_latex): (0.18m * 0.0225m * 0.00075m * 950kg/m³) ≈ 2.88 grams. Total band mass = 5.76 g.
        *   Mass of pouch = 0.8 g.
        *   **m_eff** = 0.8 g + (5.76 g / 3) = 0.8 g + 1.92 g = **2.72 grams (0.00272 kg)**.
        *   **η** = 0.00411 kg / (0.00411 kg + 0.00272 kg) = 0.00411 / 0.00683 ≈ **60.2%**
    *   This analysis demonstrates that approximately 60% of the stored potential energy will be converted into the projectile's kinetic energy. This is a very high efficiency for such a system.

### **4.0 Performance Projections**

By combining the analyses above, we can project the final performance metrics of the Project Artemis system.

*   **Projectile Muzzle Kinetic Energy (KE):**
    *   KE = PE_stored * η
    *   KE = 50.4 J * 0.602 ≈ **30.34 Joules**

*   **Projectile Muzzle Velocity (v):**
    *   KE = ½Mv²  =>  v = √(2 * KE / M)
    *   v = √(2 * 30.34 J / 0.00411 kg)
    *   v = √(60.68 / 0.00411) = √14764
    *   **v ≈ 121.5 m/s (or ~400 feet per second)**

*   **Precision and Accuracy Features:**
    *   **Fiber Optic Sights:** The OTT forks are machined to accept interchangeable fiber optic pins, allowing for precise aiming at known distances.
    *   **Ergonomic Grip:** Ensures a consistent, torque-free hold.
    *   **Arm Brace:** Provides a rock-solid platform, mitigating the effect of the 140 N draw force on aiming stability.
    *   **Low-Profile Band Attachment:** The wrap-and-tuck method avoids bulky clips that can interfere with the sight picture.
    *   **Center-Marked Pouch:** A small hole in the center of the DCF pouch ensures the projectile is perfectly centered for every shot, eliminating a major variable.

### **5.0 Conclusion: A Superior Integrated System**

The Project Artemis design represents a holistic, data-driven approach to slingshot engineering. Its superiority over competing entries is demonstrated not by a single feature, but by the synergistic optimization of every component:
*   The **7075-T6 aluminum frame with an integrated brace** provides an unyielding, stable platform capable of handling high-energy loads.
*   The **tapered TheraBand Gold bands** are configured to store and release **~50 Joules** of energy with maximum contraction velocity.
*   The ultra-lightweight **Dyneema pouch** and **optimized steel projectile** ensure that over **60%** of this energy is efficiently transferred.

The result is a system projected to launch a 4.11-gram projectile at over **120 m/s**, a performance metric at the peak of what is achievable with this technology. The suite of features aimed at enhancing stability and repeatability ensures this power can be deployed with exceptional precision, making Project Artemis the most effective design for this competition.
