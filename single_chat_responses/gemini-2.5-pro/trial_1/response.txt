### **Advanced Slingshot Design Proposal: A Quantitative Approach to Maximizing Power and Precision**

**Submitted by:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Competition:** University Engineering Society Slingshot Design Challenge

### **1.0 Design Philosophy & Core Principles**

This design is engineered from first principles to maximize the storage and efficient transfer of potential energy into projectile kinetic energy while minimizing sources of user-induced error to ensure superior precision. The core principles guiding this submission are:

*   **Maximization of Stored Potential Energy (SPE):** Utilizing a high-performance latex formulation with a specific tapered geometry and an extended draw length to store the maximum possible energy within the material's elastic limit.
*   **High-Efficiency Energy Transfer:** Minimizing the parasitic mass of the power system (bands and pouch) relative to the projectile mass, ensuring the majority of the stored energy is converted into the projectile's kinetic energy.
*   **Inherent Mechanical Stability:** Employing a rigid, non-flexing frame with an ergonomic interface and an arm brace to resist torque and provide a stable launch platform, decoupling the user's muscular tremor from the aiming process.
*   **Optimized External Ballistics:** Designing projectiles with high sectional density and a consistent aerodynamic profile to minimize velocity decay due to air resistance, resulting in a flatter trajectory and greater impact energy at range.

### **2.0 Component-Level Design & Analysis**

#### **2.1 The Frame (Yoke & Grip Assembly)**

*   **Design Rationale:** The frame's primary function is to serve as a rigid, stable anchor for the power system. A wide fork configuration (120 mm) minimizes the effect of any minor lateral inconsistencies in band retraction, reducing torque on the user's wrist. The "Through-The-Fork" (TTF) band attachment method ensures the projectile's line of flight is co-planar with the aiming plane, simplifying intuitive aiming. An integrated forearm brace is critical for managing the high draw forces proposed, distributing the load over a larger area and creating a stable, lever-arm system with the user's arm.

*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy
    *   **Young's Modulus (E):** 71.7 GPa
    *   **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS):** 572 MPa
    *   **Yield Strength (σ_y):** 503 MPa
    *   **Density (ρ):** 2.81 g/cm³
    *   **Justification:** This material offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the frame remains lightweight for maneuverability while providing immense rigidity to prevent any energy loss through frame flexion under load.

*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Overall Height:** 150 mm
    *   **Fork Width (outer):** 120 mm
    *   **Fork Gap (inner):** 80 mm
    *   **Fork Arm Cross-section:** 20 mm x 15 mm rectangular profile, filleted at stress concentration points.
    *   **Grip:** Ergonomically contoured, 35 mm average diameter.
    *   **Forearm Brace Length:** 220 mm, with a 70 mm wide padded cuff.

*   **Quantitative Analysis (Fork Arm Stress Analysis):**
    *   **Assumptions:** A peak draw force of 200 N is applied to each fork tip at a 30° angle from the horizontal axis. We will analyze the bending stress, which is the primary failure mode.
    *   **Model:** Each fork arm is modeled as a cantilever beam of length (L) = 125 mm from the grip center.
    *   **Force Component:** The perpendicular force component causing bending is F_perp = 200 N * sin(30°) = 100 N.
    *   **Bending Moment (M):** M = F_perp * L = 100 N * 0.125 m = 12.5 Nm.
    *   **Moment of Inertia (I) for a 20x15mm rectangular cross-section:** I = (base * height³) / 12 = (0.015 m * (0.020 m)³) / 12 = 1.0 x 10⁻⁸ m⁴.
    *   **Maximum Bending Stress (σ_max):** σ_max = (M * c) / I, where c is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber (c = 0.010 m).
        *   σ_max = (12.5 Nm * 0.010 m) / (1.0 x 10⁻⁸ m⁴) = 12.5 x 10⁶ Pa = **12.5 MPa**.
    *   **Factor of Safety (FoS):** FoS = Yield Strength / σ_max = 503 MPa / 12.5 MPa ≈ **40**.
    *   **Conclusion:** The massive factor of safety confirms the frame will exhibit negligible deflection and is vastly over-engineered against failure, ensuring a perfectly stable launch platform.

#### **2.2 The Elastic Bands (Power System)**

*   **Design Rationale:** This is the engine of the slingshot. The design employs a tapered band configuration, which is critical for maximizing projectile velocity. The wider section at the fork stores more energy, while the narrower, lighter section at the pouch has less inertia, accelerating faster. This creates a "cracking the whip" effect, transferring energy more efficiently to the projectile.

*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** TheraBand Gold™ Latex Sheeting (or equivalent high-performance natural latex).
    *   **Energy Storage Density:** ~250 kJ/m³ at optimal stretch.
    *   **Elongation at Break:** >600%.
    *   **Hysteresis:** Approximately 10-15% energy loss as heat per cycle.
    *   **Justification:** This material is industry-standard for its high retraction velocity, excellent energy storage capacity, and durability.

*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Configuration:** Double-band set.
    *   **Taper:** 25 mm width at the fork end, tapering linearly to 15 mm at the pouch end.
    *   **Active Length (unstretched):** 200 mm.
    *   **Draw Length (anchor point to fork):** 800 mm.
    *   **Stretch Ratio:** 800 mm / 200 mm = **4.0x** (a 400% elongation, well within the material's optimal range).

*   **Quantitative Analysis (Energy Storage & Output):**
    *   **Force-Draw Profile (Approximation):** The force-draw curve for latex is non-linear. However, for analysis, we can use empirical data. A bandset of this specification will generate a peak draw force of approximately **185 N per band**, for a total of **370 N (~83 lbf)**.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (SPE):** Calculated by integrating the area under the force-draw curve. Using a simplified trapezoidal approximation (average force x distance):
        *   Average Force ≈ (F_initial + F_final) / 2 = (0 + 370 N) / 2 = 185 N.
        *   SPE = Average Force * Draw Length = 185 N * 0.80 m = **148 Joules**.
    *   **Effective Mass of Bands:** The kinetic energy of the retracting bands must be accounted for. The effective mass is approximately one-third of the total band mass.
        *   Band Volume ≈ (Avg Width * Thickness * Length) * 2 = (0.020m * 0.0015m * 0.20m) * 2 = 1.2 x 10⁻⁵ m³.
        *   Band Mass (m_bands) = Volume * Density (ρ ≈ 950 kg/m³) = 1.2 x 10⁻⁵ m³ * 950 kg/m³ = 0.0114 kg (11.4 g).
        *   Effective Band Mass (m_eff_bands) = m_bands / 3 ≈ **3.8 grams**.

#### **2.3 The Pouch**

*   **Design Rationale:** The pouch's primary design constraint is to be as lightweight as possible while being durable and providing a consistent, clean release. A lighter pouch minimizes parasitic mass, directly increasing energy transfer efficiency.

*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** Single-piece Dyneema® Composite Fabric (DCF), 2.92 oz/yd².
    *   **Tensile Strength:** Exceptionally high for its weight.
    *   **Density:** ~0.97 g/cm³.
    *   **Justification:** DCF offers the highest tensile strength-to-weight ratio of any commercially available fabric, making it the ideal material for a low-mass, high-strength pouch.

*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Shape:** Rectangular, 70 mm x 35 mm.
    *   **Features:** A small centering dimple is pressed into the fabric to ensure consistent projectile placement.
    *   **Mass Calculation:** Pouch Area = 0.070m * 0.035m = 0.00245 m². Mass ≈ **0.7 grams**.

#### **2.4 The Projectiles**

*   **Design Rationale:** Projectile selection is critical for terminal performance. A spherical shape ensures consistent aerodynamics regardless of orientation upon release. The primary goal is to maximize sectional density (SD) and, by extension, the Ballistic Coefficient (BC). High BC projectiles resist air drag more effectively, retaining velocity and energy downrange.

*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** AISI 52100 Grade 25 Chrome Steel Ball Bearing.
    *   **Density (ρ):** 7.85 g/cm³.
    *   **Justification:** Steel offers high density, perfect sphericity from the manufacturing process, and high surface hardness to prevent deformation.

*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Diameter:** 12.0 mm (r = 0.006 m).

*   **Quantitative Analysis (Mass, Energy, & Velocity):**
    *   **Volume (V):** V = (4/3) * π * r³ = (4/3) * π * (0.006 m)³ = 9.05 x 10⁻⁷ m³.
    *   **Mass (m_proj):** m_proj = V * ρ = 9.05 x 10⁻⁷ m³ * 7850 kg/m³ = 0.0071 kg = **7.1 grams**.
    *   **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** The fraction of SPE converted to projectile kinetic energy.
        *   η ≈ m_proj / (m_proj + m_pouch + m_eff_bands)
        *   η ≈ 7.1g / (7.1g + 0.7g + 3.8g) = 7.1 / 11.6 ≈ 61.2%.
    *   **Transferred Energy (KE_proj):** This accounts for both efficiency loss and hysteresis (~15%).
        *   KE_proj = SPE * η * (1 - Hysteresis Loss) = 148 J * 0.612 * 0.85 = **77.0 Joules**.
    *   **Muzzle Velocity (v₀):** KE = ½ * m * v².
        *   v₀ = sqrt(2 * KE_proj / m_proj) = sqrt(2 * 77.0 J / 0.0071 kg) = sqrt(21690) ≈ **147.3 m/s (483 fps)**.
    *   **Ballistic Performance:**
        *   **Sectional Density (SD):** SD = mass / cross-sectional area = 0.0071 kg / (π * (0.006 m)²) = **62.8 kg/m²**. This high SD value is key to its superior range and energy retention compared to lighter projectiles.
