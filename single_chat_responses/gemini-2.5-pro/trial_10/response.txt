### **Project "Artemis": A High-Performance Slingshot Design for Optimal Power and Precision**

**Submission for the University Engineering Society Slingshot Design Competition**

***

### **1.0 Executive Summary**

Project "Artemis" is a slingshot system engineered from first principles to maximize stored potential energy, optimize energy transfer efficiency, and provide a platform for exceptional precision. The design integrates an over-the-top (OTT) configuration, a high-strength 7075-T6 aluminum alloy frame with an integrated arm brace, a tapered latex power system, and a calibrated fiber-optic sighting system. Quantitative analysis indicates the system can store approximately **68 Joules** of potential energy, launching a 3.5-gram, 9.5mm steel projectile at a theoretical muzzle velocity of **~88 m/s (~289 ft/s)**. Each component has been selected and dimensioned to contribute to a synergistic whole, creating a superior platform for both power and accuracy assessments.

### **2.0 Core Design Philosophy & Governing Physics**

The design is governed by three core principles derived from fundamental physics:

1.  **Maximization of Stored Elastic Potential Energy ($U_{pe}$):** The primary energy source is the elastic bands. The stored energy is approximated by $U_{pe} = \int F(x) \, dx$. For a near-linear elastic material, this simplifies to $U_{pe} \approx \frac{1}{2} F_{max} \cdot x$, where $F_{max}$ is the maximum draw force and $x$ is the draw length. Our design maximizes both $F_{max}$ through material selection and geometry, and $x$ through ergonomic design allowing for a long, stable draw.
2.  **Optimization of Energy Transfer Efficiency ($\eta$):** The conversion of stored potential energy to projectile kinetic energy ($KE_{proj} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) is never 100%. The efficiency, $\eta$, is critical. Project Artemis minimizes energy loss by:
    *   Reducing the kinetic energy wasted on accelerating the bands themselves ($KE_{bands}$) by using lightweight, tapered bands.
    *   Selecting a low-hysteresis elastomer to minimize thermal losses.
    *   Using a lightweight pouch to reduce parasitic mass.
3.  **Minimization of User-Induced Error:** Precision is a function of system stability and repeatability. This design mitigates error through:
    *   A rigid, non-flexing frame.
    *   An arm brace to counteract wrist torque and instability.
    *   A calibrated sighting system for consistent aim points.
    *   An Over-the-Top (OTT) band configuration for a direct, linear force vector.

### **3.0 Component-Level Design & Quantitative Analysis**

#### **3.1 Frame (Yoke) and Arm Brace**

*   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy.
    *   **Rationale:** This material offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, crucial for a rigid yet manageable frame. Its high Young's Modulus ensures minimal flex under load, which is critical for accuracy.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   Ultimate Tensile Strength ($\sigma_{uts}$): ~572 MPa
        *   Yield Strength ($\sigma_y$): ~503 MPa
        *   Young's Modulus (E): 71.7 GPa
        *   Density ($\rho$): 2810 kg/m³
*   **Geometry & Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Over-the-Top (OTT). This aligns the bands' line of action directly over the user's hand, minimizing torque on the wrist and preventing "hand slap," thereby improving accuracy and consistency.
    *   **Overall Height:** 130 mm
    *   **Fork Width (Outside):** 95 mm
    *   **Fork Gap:** 50 mm
    *   **Fork Tip Width:** 22.5 mm (with rounded edges to prevent band wear)
    *   **Grip:** Ergonomically shaped, 30 mm thick, with a "pinky hole" for secure and repeatable hand placement.
    *   **Arm Brace:** An integrated, curved brace extending 150 mm back from the base of the grip, designed to distribute force along the forearm.
*   **Stress Analysis (Estimate):**
    *   Assuming a max draw force of 170 N (see section 3.2), each fork will experience a tensile/compressive load of ~85 N. Given a cross-sectional area at the fork's thinnest point of ~150 mm² (e.g., 10mm x 15mm), the resulting stress is $\sigma = F/A = 85 \text{ N} / 150 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2 = 0.57 \text{ MPa}$.
    *   This stress is three orders of magnitude below the material's yield strength of 503 MPa, confirming the frame will exhibit no plastic deformation and negligible elastic deformation.

#### **3.2 Power System: Tapered Bands**

*   **Material:** Premium Natural Latex Sheeting (e.g., SimpleShot Premium or TheraBand Gold).
    *   **Rationale:** High-quality latex exhibits excellent elongation properties (~600-700%) and low hysteresis, resulting in an energy return efficiency of approximately 95%.
    *   **Properties:**
        *   Thickness: 0.7 mm
*   **Geometry & Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Tapered Flat Bands. A taper from fork to pouch reduces the effective mass of the bands that must be accelerated, increasing contraction velocity (based on the principles of Tapered Band Theory).
    *   **Taper:** 25 mm (at the fork) to 20 mm (at the pouch).
    *   **Active Length:** 180 mm (unstretched).
*   **Force & Energy Analysis:**
    *   **Draw Length ($x$):** 80 cm (0.8 m). This is a standardized full "butterfly" draw for a user of average height.
    *   **Max Draw Force ($F_{max}$):** Based on empirical data for this latex configuration, the expected draw force at 80 cm is approximately **170 N (~38 lbf)**.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy ($U_{pe}$):** While latex is a non-Hookean material, we can approximate the stored energy as the area under the force-draw curve. A linear approximation provides a conservative estimate:
        $U_{pe} \approx \frac{1}{2} F_{max} \cdot x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 170 \text{ N} \cdot 0.8 \text{ m} = \mathbf{68 \text{ Joules}}$

#### **3.3 Pouch**

*   **Material:** Dyneema-Microfiber Composite.
    *   **Rationale:** This material is chosen for its extremely low mass, high tensile strength, and near-zero stretch. A lightweight pouch minimizes parasitic mass, ensuring a higher percentage of stored energy is transferred to the projectile.
    *   **Mass:** < 0.8 grams
    *   **Dimensions:** 55 mm x 20 mm, with a 3 mm centering hole for consistent projectile placement.

#### **3.4 Sighting System**

*   **Design:** Adjustable Fiber Optic Sights.
    *   **Rationale:** A non-adjustable sight is only accurate at one specific range. This design incorporates a dovetail rail machined into the top of each fork tip. A small block containing a 1.5mm fiber optic pin can be slid along this rail and locked with a set screw.
    *   **Function:** This allows for precise calibration. The user can set the sights for known distances (e.g., 10m, 20m, 30m), using the changing gap between the pins as the rear sight and the target as the front sight. This transforms instinctive aiming into a repeatable, mechanical process.

### **4.0 Projectile Design & Ballistics**

*   **Material:** Grade 100 Chromium Steel Ball Bearing.
    *   **Rationale:** Steel offers high density, ensuring maximum mass for a given diameter. This maximizes momentum ($p=mv$) and kinetic energy, leading to better energy retention and reduced wind deflection downrange (higher ballistic coefficient). The spherical shape provides consistent aerodynamics regardless of orientation.
    *   **Properties:**
        *   Density ($\rho$): ~7850 kg/m³
*   **Dimensions & Mass:**
    *   **Diameter (d):** 9.5 mm (3/8 inch)
    *   **Radius (r):** 4.75 mm
    *   **Volume (V):** $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi (0.00475 \text{ m})^3 \approx 4.489 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^3$
    *   **Mass (m):** $m = \rho \cdot V = 7850 \text{ kg/m}^3 \cdot 4.489 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}^3 \approx \mathbf{0.00352 \text{ kg} (3.52 \text{ grams})}$

### **5.0 System-Wide Performance Projections**

#### **5.1 Muzzle Velocity & Kinetic Energy**

*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency ($\eta$):** We assume a conservative efficiency of $\eta = 0.85$ (85%). This accounts for hysteresis in the latex (~5%), the kinetic energy imparted to the bands and pouch, and minor air resistance losses during the power stroke.
*   **Projectile Kinetic Energy ($KE_{proj}$):**
    $KE_{proj} = U_{pe} \cdot \eta = 68 \text{ J} \cdot 0.85 = \mathbf{57.8 \text{ Joules}}$
*   **Theoretical Muzzle Velocity ($v_0$):**
    $KE_{proj} = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$
    $v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot KE_{proj}}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 57.8 \text{ J}}{0.00352 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{32840 \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2}$
    $v_0 \approx \mathbf{88.1 \text{ m/s} (\approx 289 \text{ ft/s})}$

#### **5.2 Precision Enhancements Summary**

The superiority of Project Artemis in precision is not accidental but the result of deliberate engineering choices:
1.  **Stable Platform:** The 7075-T6 frame and arm brace create an exceptionally stable, torque-resistant platform.
2.  **Repeatable Anchor:** The ergonomic grip encourages a consistent hand position for every shot.
3.  **Linear Force:** The OTT design eliminates lateral forces that can corrupt a shot.
4.  **Calibrated Aiming:** The adjustable fiber optic sights allow for a quantifiable and repeatable aiming methodology, far superior to instinctive aiming under pressure.
5.  **Ammunition Consistency:** The use of precision steel ball bearings ensures identical mass and aerodynamic properties for every shot, removing a major variable.

### **6.0 Conclusion**

Project "Artemis" represents a holistic approach to slingshot design, where every component is justified by established physical principles and quantitative analysis. The synergistic combination of a high-strength, ergonomically optimized frame, a scientifically tapered power system, and a precision sighting mechanism results in a platform that excels in the competition's core metrics. It is engineered not just to be powerful, but to be predictably and repeatedly accurate, demonstrating a mastery of the underlying physics of energy storage, transfer, and ballistics.
