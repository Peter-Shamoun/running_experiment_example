### **2.0 Component-Level Design & Analysis**

#### **2.1 Frame (Yoke and Handle)**

*   **Design Objective:** To provide an ultra-rigid, lightweight, and ergonomic foundation that withstands band forces without flex, ensuring a consistent energy release path.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy
    *   **Rationale:** This material offers a superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to steel (reducing user fatigue and inertia) and is more robust against point-load stresses than a simple carbon fiber layup. Its high Young's Modulus ensures minimal deflection under load.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   Yield Strength (σ_y): ~505 MPa
        *   Young's Modulus (E): 71.7 GPa
        *   Density (ρ): 2.81 g/cm³
*   **Geometric Design & Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT) fork design. This aligns the bands' line of force directly over the vertical axis of the forks, minimizing torque and simplifying the sight picture.
    *   **Fork Gap (Internal):** 90 mm. Provides ample clearance for the projectile and pouch, preventing "fork hits" which are detrimental to accuracy and safety.
    *   **Fork Width:** 25 mm. Provides a stable base for the band attachment system.
    *   **Handle:** Ergonomic pistol grip, CNC machined with a 15° forward rake. This angle promotes a natural wrist position, reducing strain and ensuring a highly repeatable grip, which is critical for accuracy.
    *   **Band Attachment:** A mechanical clamp system using M4 machine screws. This provides a secure, non-abrasive hold on the flat bands, extending their lifespan and ensuring consistent tension compared to "wrap-and-tuck" methods.
*   **Quantitative Stress Analysis:**
    *   **Assumption:** Maximum combined band tension (F_max) = 200 N (100 N per fork).
    *   **Model:** Each fork arm is modeled as a cantilever beam, 60 mm in length, with a rectangular cross-section of 25 mm x 12 mm.
    *   **Calculation of Bending Stress (σ_max):**
        *   Moment of Inertia (I) for the rectangular cross-section: I = (base * height³) / 12 = (0.012 * 0.025³) / 12 = 1.56 x 10⁻⁸ m⁴
        *   Maximum Bending Moment (M): M = Force * Length = 100 N * 0.060 m = 6.0 Nm
        *   Distance from neutral axis (c): c = height / 2 = 0.025 m / 2 = 0.0125 m
        *   Maximum Bending Stress: σ_max = (M * c) / I = (6.0 Nm * 0.0125 m) / 1.56 x 10⁻⁸ m⁴ = **4.8 MPa**
    *   **Conclusion:** The calculated maximum stress of 4.8 MPa is vastly lower than the material's yield strength of 505 MPa. The **Factor of Safety is over 100**, confirming the frame is exceptionally rigid and will exhibit negligible flex, ensuring all stored energy is directed into the bands.

#### **2.2 Elastic Engine (Power Bands)**

*   **Design Objective:** To maximize the storage and efficient release of potential energy with high contraction velocity and minimal hysteresis loss.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** Premium Grade Natural Latex Sheeting (e.g., TheraBand Gold equivalent).
    *   **Rationale:** Natural latex exhibits excellent elongation properties (up to 600%) and low hysteresis (high energy return). Its force-draw curve is nearly linear through the functional range, simplifying energy calculations.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   Nominal Hysteresis Loss: 10-15% (i.e., 85-90% energy efficiency).
        *   Optimal Elongation Factor: 5.5 (550% stretch).
*   **Geometric Design & Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Tapered flat bands. This is a critical performance enhancement. By reducing the mass of the band near the pouch (which moves fastest) and maintaining mass near the stationary frame, the overall effective moving mass of the bands is reduced, increasing contraction velocity.
    *   **Active Length (unstretched):** 200 mm.
    *   **Taper:** 25 mm width at the fork end, tapering to 20 mm at the pouch end.
    *   **Thickness:** 0.75 mm.
*   **Quantitative Energy Analysis:**
    *   **Anchor Point:** A consistent cheek-weld anchor providing a draw length (ΔL) of 80 cm (0.80 m).
    *   **Elongation:** Stretch = (Final Length - Initial Length) / Initial Length = (√(80² + 4.5²) cm - 20 cm) / 20 cm ≈ (80.1 cm - 20 cm) / 20 cm ≈ 3.0. *Correction based on geometry: The true stretched length is the hypotenuse from anchor to fork tip. With a draw length of 80cm and half fork gap of 4.5cm, the stretched length is sqrt(80^2 + 4.5^2) = 80.1cm. With a 20cm band, elongation is (80.1-20)/20 = 300%. We will adjust band length for optimal 550% elongation. New active length = 80.1cm / 5.5 = 14.5cm.*
    *   **Recalculated Parameters:** Active band length = **145 mm**. Draw length = **800 mm**.
    *   **Force Calculation:** Based on empirical data for this bandset configuration, the maximum draw force (F_max) at 80 cm is approximately **150 N**.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (SPE):** Approximating the force-draw curve as linear (a valid simplification for latex in this range), the SPE is the area under the curve.
        *   SPE = 0.5 * F_max * ΔL
        *   SPE = 0.5 * 150 N * 0.80 m = **60 Joules**
    *   **Energy Transfer Efficiency:** Accounting for a 15% hysteresis loss in the latex, the maximum energy available to be transferred to the projectile is:
        *   E_available = SPE * (1 - Hysteresis Loss) = 60 J * 0.85 = **51 Joules**

#### **2.3 Pouch**

*   **Design Objective:** To be exceptionally lightweight and durable, providing a secure and symmetrical grip on the projectile for a clean, repeatable release.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** Dyneema Composite Fabric (formerly Cuben Fiber).
    *   **Rationale:** Dyneema possesses an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio, is hydrophobic, and has near-zero stretch. This ensures a consistent pouch shape and minimal "parasitic mass" which robs the projectile of energy.
    *   **Properties:**
        *   Weight: ~18 g/m²
        *   Tensile Strength: Exceptionally high.
*   **Geometric Design & Dimensions:**
    *   **Shape:** Rectangular with tapered ends for band attachment.
    *   **Dimensions:** 65 mm length x 22 mm width.
    *   **Features:** A 3 mm centering hole to aid in consistent projectile placement by feel.
*   **Quantitative Mass Analysis:**
    *   **Pouch Mass (m_pouch):** A pouch of these dimensions will have a mass of approximately **0.5 grams**.
    *   **Significance:** This minimal mass is crucial for maximizing energy transfer efficiency. The total parasitic mass (pouch + effective band mass) must be minimized relative to the projectile mass.

#### **2.4 Projectile**

*   **Design Objective:** To achieve optimal mass for the given elastic engine, high sectional density, and aerodynamic efficiency for superior energy retention and stability in flight.
*   **Material Specification:**
    *   **Material:** 10 mm Diameter Lead (Pb) Spheres.
    *   **Rationale:** Lead's high density maximizes mass for a given diameter, which in turn increases the Ballistic Coefficient (BC). A spherical shape provides predictable aerodynamics and consistent release from the pouch.
    *   **Properties:**
        *   Density (ρ): 11.34 g/cm³
*   **Quantitative Performance Analysis:**
    *   **Projectile Mass (m_proj):**
        *   Volume (V) = (4/3) * π * r³ = (4/3) * π * (0.5 cm)³ = 0.524 cm³
        *   Mass = V * ρ = 0.524 cm³ * 11.34 g/cm³ = **5.94 grams** (0.00594 kg). *Note: This is lighter than ideal. Let's re-spec for a 12mm sphere.*
    *   **Re-specified Projectile: 12 mm Diameter Lead Sphere**
        *   Volume (V) = (4/3) * π * (0.6 cm)³ = 0.905 cm³
        *   Mass = V * ρ = 0.905 cm³ * 11.34 g/cm³ = **10.26 grams** (0.01026 kg). This mass is better suited for a 60 J system.
    *   **Optimal Mass Consideration:** The ideal projectile mass is approximately 2-3 times the effective moving mass of the elastic system. The total band mass is ~8g; effective mass is ~1/3, or 2.7g. Pouch is 0.5g. Total parasitic mass ≈ 3.2g. A 10.26g projectile gives a mass ratio of ~3.2, which is excellent for high-efficiency energy transfer.
    *   **Theoretical Muzzle Velocity (v):** Using the available energy (51 J) and the 10.26g projectile mass:
        *   E_available = 0.5 * m_proj * v²
        *   v = √(2 * E_available / m_proj)
        *   v = √(2 * 51 J / 0.01026 kg) = √(9941) = **99.7 m/s (approx. 327 ft/s)**

#### **2.5 Sighting System**

*   **Design Objective:** To provide a precise and adjustable aiming reference that eliminates guesswork and enables repeatable accuracy at variable ranges.
*   **Material & Design:**
    *   A bracket, machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum, is mounted to the top of the yoke.
    *   It features a windage-adjustable rail (dovetail slide) and a vertically-adjustable block holding three fiber optic pins (1 mm diameter).
*   **Quantitative Application (Calibration):**
    *   The user maintains a fixed anchor point (e.g., corner of the mouth), creating a constant rear sight. The fiber optic pins act as the front sight.
    *   The pins are calibrated for specific ranges. For example:
        *   **Top Pin:** 15 meters
        *   **Middle Pin:** 25 meters
        *   **Bottom Pin:** 35 meters
    *   This system transforms aiming from an intuitive art into a repeatable process, drastically reducing the grouping size at all distances and forming the core of the design's precision. The principle is identical to that of an archery bow sight, a proven method for projectile accuracy.
