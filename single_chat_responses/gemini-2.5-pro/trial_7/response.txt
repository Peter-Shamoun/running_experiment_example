### **Design Proposal: The "Newton's Fulcrum" Precision Slingshot**

**Submission ID:** ENG-SS-001
**Lead Designer:** [Your Name]
**Date:** [Date]

### **Abstract**

This document outlines the design and quantitative analysis of the "Newton's Fulcrum," a projectile launch system engineered for maximal energy storage, optimal transfer efficiency, and superior shot-to-shot consistency. The design philosophy centers on a systems-based approach, where each component is optimized to contribute to two primary performance metrics: projectile kinetic energy (power) and minimal shot dispersion at range (precision). Through the strategic selection of advanced materials, a meticulously calculated geometry, and the integration of stability-enhancing features, the Newton's Fulcrum is projected to achieve a stored potential energy of over 80 Joules and a projectile muzzle velocity exceeding 85 m/s, establishing a new benchmark for non-compound elastic-powered launchers.

### **1.0 Design Philosophy and Guiding Principles**

The design is governed by the fundamental principles of work-energy, material science, and ergonomics.

*   **1.1 Maximization of Stored Potential Energy:** The system's power is dictated by the potential energy stored in the elastic bands, approximated by the integral of the force-draw curve, $U = \int F(x) \,dx$. Our design maximizes this integral by selecting a high-performance elastomer and employing a long draw length, enabled by a stable, ergonomic frame.
*   **1.2 Optimization of Energy Transfer Efficiency ($\eta$):** Stored energy is useless if not efficiently converted to projectile kinetic energy ($KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$). Efficiency is maximized by minimizing parasitic mass (pouch and band tips), reducing internal damping in the bands, and ensuring a clean, frictionless release.
*   **1.3 Enhancement of Precision and Stability:** Accuracy is a function of system stability and user interface. The design incorporates features to minimize user-induced error, such as torque and vibration. This is achieved through an optimized center of mass, ergonomic grip geometry, and an integrated sighting system.
*   **1.4 Structural Integrity and Safety:** The frame must withstand peak draw forces with a safety factor of at least 5 to prevent catastrophic failure. Material selection is based on a high strength-to-weight ratio and fatigue resistance.

### **2.0 Component-Level Design Blueprint**

#### **2.1 Frame (Yoke and Handle)**

*   **Function:** Provides the structural foundation, anchors the elastic bands, and serves as the primary user interface.
*   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy.
    *   **Rationale:** This aerospace-grade alloy offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, superior to common 6061 aluminum, steel, or composites in this application. Its high fatigue strength is critical for repeated loading cycles.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Ultimate Tensile Strength:** 572 MPa
        *   **Yield Strength:** 503 MPa
        *   **Young's Modulus:** 71.7 GPa
        *   **Density:** 2810 kg/m³
*   **Geometry and Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT) design. This aligns the bands' line of action directly over the support forks, minimizing torque on the user's wrist and providing a more intuitive sight picture.
    *   **Overall Height:** 140 mm
    *   **Outer Fork Width:** 95 mm
    *   **Inner Fork Gap:** 55 mm (Wide gap to eliminate "band slap" and ensure a clean projectile path).
    *   **Fork Tip Profile:** Rounded, 10 mm radius with a 2 mm chamfer to prevent band abrasion. Features a groove for secure band attachment via the "wrap and tuck" method.
    *   **Handle:** Ergonomically contoured with a palm swell. Cross-sectional area is optimized for a full-fisted grip to distribute pressure and enhance stability. A 1/4"-20 UNC threaded insert is integrated at the base for attaching a stabilizer.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Fork Stress):**
    *   **Peak Load:** Estimated peak draw force ($F_{peak}$) = 200 N. Each fork supports ~100 N.
    *   **Bending Moment:** Treating the fork as a cantilever beam, the maximum bending moment ($M$) at the base is $M = F \times L$, where L is the fork height (~100 mm). $M = 100 \text{ N} \times 0.1 \text{ m} = 10 \text{ Nm}$.
    *   **Stress Calculation:** The bending stress ($\sigma$) is $\sigma = \frac{Mc}{I}$. For a rectangular fork cross-section of 20mm x 12mm, the moment of inertia ($I$) is $\frac{bh^3}{12}$ and $c = h/2$.
    *   $\sigma_{max} \approx 41.7 \text{ MPa}$.
    *   **Safety Factor:** $SF = \frac{\text{Yield Strength}}{\sigma_{max}} = \frac{503 \text{ MPa}}{41.7 \text{ MPa}} \approx 12$. This high safety factor ensures absolute structural integrity.

#### **2.2 Elastic Power System**

*   **Function:** The "engine" of the slingshot, storing and releasing potential energy.
*   **Material:** TheraBand Gold Latex Sheeting.
    *   **Rationale:** This material is the industry standard for high-performance slingshots, offering exceptional elongation (over 600%), high retraction velocity, and good service life.
    *   **Mechanical Properties (Approximate):**
        *   **Tensile Strength:** ~24 MPa
        *   **Retraction Velocity:** High, contributing to efficiency.
*   **Geometry and Dimensions:**
    *   **Configuration:** Tapered bands. A 25 mm width at the fork tapers linearly to a 15 mm width at the pouch.
    *   **Rationale:** Tapering ensures that the entire band contracts at a more uniform, high velocity. The wider section at the fork handles higher stress, while the lighter, narrower section at the pouch accelerates more rapidly, improving energy transfer to the projectile (reduces "tip weight" penalty).
    *   **Active Length (at rest):** 200 mm.
    *   **Draw Length (from fork tip):** 800 mm (31.5 inches).
    *   **Elongation Ratio:** 400% ($800 \text{ mm} / 200 \text{ mm}$).
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Force and Energy):**
    *   The force-draw curve of latex is non-linear. However, for analysis, we can approximate it with an effective spring constant ($k_{eff}$).
    *   **Estimated Peak Force:** Based on empirical data for this bandset, the peak force at 800 mm draw is approximately **200 N (45 lbf)**.
    *   **Stored Potential Energy (U):** Integrating the force-draw curve (approximated as $F(x) = ax^b$, where b is slightly less than 1), the stored energy is estimated. A simplified linear model gives a lower bound:
        *   $U \approx \frac{1}{2} F_{peak} \cdot x_{draw} = 0.5 \times 200 \text{ N} \times 0.8 \text{ m} = \textbf{80 Joules}$.
        *   The actual value, accounting for non-linearity, is expected to be slightly higher, in the range of **80-85 Joules**.

#### **2.3 Pouch**

*   **Function:** Securely holds the projectile and provides a clean, consistent release.
*   **Material:** Multi-layer Microfiber Fabric (e.g., "SuperSuede").
    *   **Rationale:** This material is extremely lightweight, has negligible stretch (ensuring a crisp release), and is highly resistant to abrasion. Kangaroo leather is a viable alternative but is heavier. Minimizing pouch mass is critical for efficiency.
*   **Dimensions:**
    *   **Overall Size:** 55 mm x 20 mm.
    *   **Mass:** < 0.8 grams.
    *   **Features:** A 3 mm centering hole allows for tactile confirmation of projectile placement, improving consistency.

### **3.0 Projectile Specification**

*   **Function:** The mass that is accelerated to store and deliver kinetic energy.
*   **Material:** Grade 100 Chromium Steel Ball Bearings.
    *   **Rationale:** Steel provides high density, leading to a high sectional density and ballistic coefficient. This allows the projectile to retain velocity and energy more effectively downrange by minimizing the effects of air resistance. The spherical shape ensures predictable aerodynamics.
    *   **Density:** ~7850 kg/m³
*   **Dimensions and Mass Selection:**
    *   **Primary Projectile:** 9.5 mm (3/8 inch) diameter sphere.
    *   **Mass:** 3.5 grams.
    *   **Secondary (Heavy) Projectile:** 12.0 mm (0.47 inch) diameter sphere.
    *   **Mass:** 7.0 grams.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Mass Optimization):**
    *   Lighter projectiles achieve higher velocity, but heavier projectiles carry more kinetic energy (due to higher system efficiency) and resist drag better. The optimal mass is a trade-off. Our system is tuned for the 7.0g to 9.0g range for maximum power and range.

### **4.0 System-Level Performance Projections**

This section integrates the component analyses to predict overall system performance.

#### **4.1 Muzzle Velocity and Kinetic Energy**

*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency ($\eta$):** For a well-tuned system with tapered bands and a lightweight pouch, an efficiency of 85% is a realistic target.
*   **Projectile Kinetic Energy ($KE_{proj}$):**
    *   $KE_{proj} = U_{stored} \times \eta = 80 \text{ J} \times 0.85 = \textbf{68 Joules}$.
*   **Muzzle Velocity ($v$):**
    *   $v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot KE_{proj}}{m}}$
    *   **For 7.0g (0.007 kg) steel projectile:**
        *   $v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 68 \text{ J}}{0.007 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{19428} \approx \textbf{139.4 m/s (457 ft/s)}$
    *   **For 9.5g (0.0095 kg) steel projectile:**
        *   $v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 68 \text{ J}}{0.0095 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{14315} \approx \textbf{119.6 m/s (392 ft/s)}$

*Note: These velocities are theoretical and represent the upper performance limit.*

#### **4.2 Precision-Enhancing Features**

*   **Integrated Sighting System:** The OTT frame forks are machined to accept interchangeable fiber optic pins, allowing for precise, repeatable aiming at known distances.
*   **Stabilizer Mount:** The 1/4"-20 threaded insert allows for the attachment of a carbon fiber rod and counterweight. This increases the system's moment of inertia, dramatically reducing user-induced tremors and torquing effects during the draw and release, leading to significantly tighter shot groupings.
*   **Ergonomic Grip:** The handle design locks the slingshot into the user's hand consistently on every shot, ensuring the same point of force application and minimizing variables.
