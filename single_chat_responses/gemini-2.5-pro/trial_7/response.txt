### **Project "Artemis": A High-Performance Slingshot Design for Maximum Energy Transfer and Precision**

**Submitted for the University Engineering Society Slingshot Design Competition**

---

### **1.0 Design Philosophy and Core Principles**

The "Artemis" slingshot is engineered from first principles to maximize performance in two key domains: power (energy storage and transfer) and precision (repeatability and accuracy). The design philosophy is predicated on a systems-approach, where each component is optimized not in isolation, but for its contribution to the total performance envelope.

The core engineering principles guiding this design are:

1.  **Maximization of Stored Potential Energy:** Utilizing a high-performance elastomer in a tapered configuration with an extended draw length to store the maximum possible elastic potential energy.
2.  **Optimization of Energy Transfer Efficiency:** Minimizing non-projectile kinetic energy (e.g., band and pouch mass) and hysteretic losses to convert the highest percentage of stored potential energy into projectile kinetic energy.
3.  **Enhancement of Stability and Repeatability:** Employing an ergonomic and structurally rigid frame, a consistent projectile interface, and an adjustable sighting system to mitigate user-induced error and ensure shot-to-shot consistency.

### **2.0 Component-Level Design and Quantitative Analysis**

#### **2.1 Frame (Yoke)**

The frame serves as the structural backbone, providing the platform for energy storage and the interface for the user. Its design must prioritize rigidity, low mass, and ergonomics.

*   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT). This configuration is deliberately chosen to align the forward trajectory of the bands directly over the forks, minimizing the vertical "flipper" effect upon release. This creates a more direct and intuitive line of sight, which is paramount for precision.
*   **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy.
    *   **Rationale:** This material offers an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, superior to common 6061 aluminum and steel. Its high Young's Modulus ensures minimal frame flex under high tension, preventing energy loss and unpredictable shot variation.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:**
        *   **Yield Strength:** ~503 MPa
        *   **Young's Modulus:** 71.7 GPa
        *   **Density:** 2.81 g/cm³
*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Fork Width (Outer):** 90 mm. This width provides a stable platform and allows for a clear sight picture without being so wide as to induce significant wrist torque.
    *   **Fork Tip Width:** 22 mm. Provides a robust surface for band attachment.
    *   **Fork Tip Design:** Features a 10 mm radius rounded groove for band placement. This smooth, large-radius curve minimizes stress concentration on the elastic bands, significantly increasing their operational lifespan.
    *   **Handle:** Ergonomically contoured with a 110 mm length and a "pinky hole" at the base. This locks the user's hand into a consistent, repeatable grip, mitigating torque and ensuring the frame is held in the same orientation for every shot.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Fork Stress):**
    *   Assuming a maximum draw force of 160 N, each fork arm supports a tension of approximately 80 N.
    *   Modeling the fork arm as a simple cantilever beam, the primary stress is tensile. The cross-sectional area at the thinnest point (e.g., 22 mm x 10 mm = 220 mm²) experiences a stress (σ) of:
        *   σ = Force / Area = 80 N / 220 mm² = 0.36 MPa.
    *   **Conclusion:** This stress is negligible compared to the 503 MPa yield strength of 7075-T6 aluminum, yielding a safety factor of over 1300. The design is overwhelmingly robust against material failure.

#### **2.2 Elastic Band Assembly**

This is the engine of the slingshot. The design focuses on maximizing stored energy and release velocity.

*   **Material:** TheraBand Gold™ Latex Sheeting.
    *   **Rationale:** This material is the industry standard for high-performance slingshots due to its excellent elongation properties, high retraction velocity, and well-documented performance characteristics.
*   **Configuration:** Tapered Bands.
    *   **Rationale:** The section of the band attached to the pouch must accelerate to the projectile's speed, while the section at the fork remains static. A tapered band (wider at the fork, narrower at the pouch) reduces the moving mass of the elastic itself. This "dead mass" reduction significantly improves energy transfer efficiency and projectile velocity.
    *   **Dimensions:**
        *   **Active Length:** 200 mm (unstretched).
        *   **Fork-End Width:** 30 mm.
        *   **Pouch-End Width:** 20 mm.
        *   **Resulting Taper:** 30-20 mm.
*   **Quantitative Analysis (Energy Storage):**
    *   The force-draw curve of latex is non-linear. However, for engineering estimates, we can approximate it. For a 200 mm active length band set, a typical draw length to the cheek anchor point is ~800 mm. This represents a 400% elongation (Draw Length / Active Length).
    *   At this elongation, this band configuration will generate a peak draw force (F_max) of approximately **160 N** (~36 lbs-force).
    *   The stored potential energy (PE) is the integral of the force-draw curve, ∫F(x)dx. We can approximate this as the area of a trapezoid or by using an average force: PE ≈ F_avg * x_draw.
    *   F_avg ≈ 0.55 * F_max (due to non-linearity) ≈ 0.55 * 160 N = 88 N.
    *   **Estimated Stored Potential Energy (PE):**
        *   PE = 88 N * 0.80 m = **70.4 Joules**.

#### **2.3 Pouch**

The pouch is the critical interface between the energy source (bands) and the payload (projectile).

*   **Material:** Multi-layer Kangaroo Leather with Dyneema® fabric core.
    *   **Rationale:** Kangaroo leather offers the highest tensile strength-to-weight ratio of any commercially available leather, minimizing pouch mass. The embedded Dyneema® core provides exceptional dimensional stability, preventing stretching under load and ensuring a consistent release point.
    *   **Mass:** Target mass is < 1.0 gram.
*   **Design:**
    *   **Dimensions:** 55 mm x 22 mm.
    *   **Features:** A 3 mm centered indexing hole. This allows the user to feel the projectile seated in the exact center of the pouch, drastically improving shot-to-shot consistency.

#### **2.4 Projectile**

The choice of projectile is a trade-off between kinetic energy, velocity, and external ballistics.

*   **Material:** Grade 100 Chrome Steel Ball Bearing.
    *   **Rationale:** Steel offers high density and perfect sphericity. The high grade ensures uniformity in mass and dimensions, which is critical for precision.
*   **Specification:**
    *   **Diameter:** 9.5 mm (3/8 inch).
    *   **Density (ρ):** ~7850 kg/m³.
    *   **Volume (V):** V = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(0.00475 m)³ ≈ 4.489 x 10⁻⁷ m³.
    *   **Mass (m):** m = ρV = 7850 * 4.489 x 10⁻⁷ ≈ 0.00352 kg or **3.52 grams**.
*   **Rationale for Selection:** This mass is an optimal balance. It is heavy enough to retain significant kinetic energy and resist wind drift, yet light enough to achieve a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory over typical competition distances.

#### **2.5 Sighting System**

To achieve true precision, an intuitive and adjustable aiming system is non-negotiable.

*   **Type:** Adjustable Twin-Pin Fiber Optic Sight.
*   **Construction:** A machined 7075-T6 aluminum bracket mounted to the top of the yoke. It will house two 1.5mm fiber optic pins.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Elevation Adjustment:** The entire bracket can be moved up or down via a fine-threaded screw, allowing the shooter to zero the slingshot for specific distances (e.g., top pin for 10m, bottom pin for 20m).
    *   **Windage Adjustment:** The pins can be moved left or right along a dovetailed slide.
    *   **Rationale:** This system transforms the slingshot from an instinctual tool into a precision instrument. It allows the user to aim with a consistent sight picture, compensating for projectile drop and environmental factors, a feature that will be absent in more rudimentary designs.

### **3.0 System Integration and Performance Projections**

This section integrates the component analyses to predict the total system performance.

#### **3.1 Energy Transfer and Muzzle Velocity**

*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** Not all of the 70.4 J of stored potential energy becomes projectile kinetic energy. Losses occur due to:
    1.  Kinetic energy imparted to the bands and pouch.
    2.  Hysteresis (heat loss) within the latex.
    3.  Air resistance on the bands during contraction.
*   **Estimate:** With our lightweight pouch and tapered band design, we project a high efficiency (η) of **75%**.
*   **Projectile Kinetic Energy (KE):**
    *   KE_projectile = PE_stored * η = 70.4 J * 0.75 = **52.8 Joules**.
*   **Projected Muzzle Velocity (v):**
    *   KE = (1/2)mv²  =>  v = √(2KE / m)
    *   v = √(2 * 52.8 J / 0.00352 kg) = √(105.6 / 0.00352) ≈ √29990
    *   **v ≈ 173.2 m/s (568 feet per second)**.

#### **3.2 Ballistics and Range (Idealized)**

*   **Maximum Ideal Range (vacuum, 45° launch angle):**
    *   R = (v² sin(2θ)) / g
    *   R = (173.2² * sin(90°)) / 9.81 = 29990 / 9.81 ≈ **3057 meters**.
*   **Realistic Range:** In practice, air resistance (drag) is the dominant factor. The drag force is F_d = 0.5 * ρ_air * v² * C_d * A. For our 9.5mm sphere, the high initial velocity means drag will rapidly bleed energy. However, the high Sectional Density of the steel projectile will give it superior energy retention compared to lighter projectiles. The effective lethal/target range would be well over 100 meters, with precision targeting (aided by the sight) viable within 30-40 meters.

#### **3.3 Summary of Superiority**

The Artemis design will demonstrate superiority over competing entries through:

1.  **Quantifiably Higher Power:** The calculated muzzle energy of **~53 Joules** will likely exceed that of designs using non-tapered bands or less efficient materials.
2.  **Unmatched Precision:** The combination of an OTT configuration, a repeatable ergonomic grip, a projectile indexing pouch, and a fully adjustable fiber optic sight provides a system for accuracy that simple, fork-sighted designs cannot match.
3.  **Engineering Rigor:** Every design choice, from the 7075-T6 aluminum to the tapered band geometry, is justified with quantitative analysis and founded in established physics principles, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the engineering challenges involved.
