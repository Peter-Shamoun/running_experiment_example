### **Project "Javelin": A High-Performance Slingshot Design Proposal**

**Submitted by:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Competition:** University Engineering Society Slingshot Design Challenge

### **Abstract**

Project "Javelin" is a competition-grade slingshot system engineered for maximum power and precision. The design philosophy prioritizes efficient energy storage and transfer, dynamic stability, and user-integrated accuracy. This is achieved through a synergy of advanced materials, an "Over-The-Top" (OTT) configuration, tapered elastic bands, and a custom-calibrated projectile. The frame is constructed from a 7075-T6 aluminum alloy core with carbon fiber laminate scales for an optimal stiffness-to-weight ratio. The power system utilizes a custom-tapered latex band configuration, calculated to maximize projectile velocity by minimizing non-productive mass acceleration. Quantitative analysis projects a stored potential energy of approximately 61 Joules, achieving an estimated projectile velocity of 89 m/s (292 fps) with a 7.2-gram chrome steel projectile, demonstrating superior performance metrics.

### **1.0 Design Philosophy & Core Principles**

The fundamental objective is to maximize the kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) delivered to the projectile with the highest possible degree of accuracy. Our design addresses this through four core principles:

1.  **Maximizing Stored Potential Energy (PE):** Employing high-performance latex with an optimal stretch ratio and draw length.
2.  **Optimizing Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** Minimizing energy losses to band hysteresis, air resistance, and the kinetic energy of the bands/pouch themselves.
3.  **Ensuring Dynamic Stability:** Designing a frame that resists torsion and flex under load and provides a consistent, recoil-mitigating shooting platform.
4.  **Enabling Shooter Accuracy:** Integrating ergonomic features and a precise sighting system to minimize user error and allow for repeatable shot placement.

### **2.0 Component-Level Design & Analysis**

#### **2.1 The Frame (Yoke)**

The frame is the foundation of the system, responsible for managing the immense forces during the draw and release.

*   **Configuration:** Over-The-Top (OTT).
    *   **Rationale:** In an OTT design, the bands travel directly over the top of the forks. This aligns the projectile's line of flight with the sighting plane, simplifying aiming. More critically, it directs the recoil force linearly back into the user's hand, drastically reducing the vertical "hand-shock" and muzzle flip common in "Through-The-Fork" (TTF) designs. This linear recoil path is paramount for shot-to-shot consistency and precision.
*   **Material:** Laminated 7075-T6 Aluminum and Carbon Fiber.
    *   **Core:** 8.0 mm thick 7075-T6 Aluminum plate.
        *   **Mechanical Properties:** Tensile Strength ≈ 572 MPa; Young's Modulus ≈ 71.7 GPa; Density ≈ 2,810 kg/m³.
        *   **Rationale:** 7075-T6 provides exceptional strength and rigidity, preventing any frame flex under the ~160 N draw force. This rigidity ensures that all stored energy is held in the bands, not lost to frame deformation.
    *   **Scales (Handle):** 2.0 mm thick 3K Twill Weave Carbon Fiber Laminate on each side.
        *   **Mechanical Properties:** Tensile Strength ≈ 600 MPa (in fiber direction); Young's Modulus ≈ 65 GPa; Density ≈ 1,600 kg/m³.
        *   **Rationale:** Carbon fiber significantly increases the overall stiffness of the handle assembly while adding minimal mass. This high stiffness-to-weight ratio creates a balanced, vibration-dampening frame that is comfortable to hold and aim. The textured weave also provides a secure grip.
*   **Dimensions & Geometry:**
    *   **Overall Height:** 125 mm
    *   **Fork Width (Outer):** 90 mm
    *   **Fork Gap (Inner):** 50 mm
    *   **Fork Tip Width:** 20 mm
    *   **Rationale:** The 90 mm width provides a clear sight picture and stable platform. The 50 mm gap is optimized to prevent "fork hits" even with slight variations in release. The 20 mm fork tips provide a broad, flat surface for secure band attachment, ensuring even tension and retraction. The handle is ergonomically contoured to fit the user's hand, promoting a consistent grip—the most critical variable in accuracy.




#### **2.2 The Power System (Elastic Bands)**

This is the engine of the slingshot. Its design is critical for both power and efficiency.

*   **Material:** GZK Green 0.62mm Latex Sheeting.
    *   **Mechanical Properties:** Elongation at Break > 700%; High retraction velocity; Low hysteresis loss (~10-15%).
    *   **Rationale:** This specific latex is selected for its documented high performance in energy storage and rapid contraction speed, which is a primary determinant of projectile velocity.
*   **Configuration:** Tapered Bands.
    *   **Dimensions:** 24 mm (at the fork) tapered to 16 mm (at the pouch) over an active length of 180 mm.
    *   **Rationale:** Tapering is the single most important feature for transfer efficiency. Based on the principle of conservation of momentum, the lighter end of the band (at the pouch) can accelerate faster than the heavier end (at the fork). This creates a "whipping" action, imparting a higher velocity to the projectile than a non-tapered band of equivalent draw weight. The mass of the band itself is reduced, meaning less of the stored PE is wasted on accelerating the rubber.
*   **Attachment Method:** "Wrap and Tuck" over the flat OTT fork tips.
    *   **Rationale:** This method is simple, secure, and creates a very low-profile attachment that does not interfere with the band's retraction path. It ensures the bands lie perfectly flat, preventing twisting that can impair accuracy.

#### **2.3 The Projectile Interface (Pouch)**

The pouch must be as light as possible while being durable and providing a consistent release.

*   **Material:** "Super-Durable" Microfiber Laminate.
    *   **Properties:** Mass ≈ 0.5 grams; High tensile strength; Non-stretch.
    *   **Rationale:** Kangaroo leather is a traditional choice, but modern microfiber laminates offer superior durability and weather resistance at a fraction of the mass. Minimizing pouch mass is critical; every gram of pouch mass is parasitic, stealing kinetic energy that should go to the projectile.
*   **Dimensions:** 55 mm length x 16 mm width, with a centered projectile dimple.
    *   **Rationale:** The size is optimized to securely cradle the 12mm projectile without excess material. The centered dimple provides tactile feedback, ensuring the projectile is loaded in the exact same position for every shot, a key factor for precision.

#### **2.4 The Projectile**

The projectile's mass and shape are tuned to the power system for maximum performance.

*   **Material:** Grade 100 Chrome Steel Ball Bearing.
    *   **Properties:** Density (ρ) ≈ 7,850 kg/m³; High sphericity and surface uniformity.
    *   **Rationale:** Steel provides maximum density, maximizing mass (and thus momentum and kinetic energy) for a given diameter. High sphericity and a smooth finish (low form drag) ensure a stable, predictable ballistic trajectory.
*   **Dimensions:** 12.0 mm diameter.
    *   **Mass Calculation:**
        *   Volume (V) = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(0.006 m)³ ≈ 9.048 x 10⁻⁷ m³
        *   Mass (m) = ρV = (7,850 kg/m³)(9.048 x 10⁻⁷ m³) ≈ **0.0071 kg (7.1 grams)**
    *   **Rationale:** This mass is the optimal balance for our power system. A lighter projectile would achieve higher velocity but suffer more from air resistance, losing energy faster over distance. A heavier projectile would be too slow, resulting in a more parabolic trajectory that is difficult to aim accurately at range.

### **3.0 Quantitative Performance Analysis**

This analysis provides the theoretical performance ceiling of the Project Javelin system.

#### **3.1 Stored Potential Energy (PE)**

We will model the force-draw curve of the latex as approximately linear for this calculation.
*   **User Draw Length (x):** 90 cm (0.9 m) from the fork.
*   **Active Band Length (L):** 18 cm (0.18 m).
*   **Stretch Ratio (S):** x / L = 90 cm / 18 cm = **5.0 (or 500%)**.
*   **Peak Draw Force (F_max):** Based on empirical data for this bandset configuration, the peak force at 500% elongation is approximately **135 Newtons** (~30.4 lbf).
*   **Stored PE Calculation:** The work done (energy stored) is the integral of the force-draw curve. For a linear approximation, this is the area of a triangle.
    *   PE = ½ * F_max * x
    *   PE = 0.5 * 135 N * 0.9 m
    *   **PE ≈ 60.75 Joules**

#### **3.2 Projectile Velocity (v)**

The conversion of stored PE to projectile KE is governed by the system's efficiency (η).
*   **Energy Transfer Efficiency (η):** Standard slingshots have η ≈ 25-35%. Due to our optimization (tapered bands, ultra-light pouch), we project a higher efficiency.
    *   **Projected η ≈ 45%**
*   **Projectile Kinetic Energy (KE):**
    *   KE = PE * η
    *   KE = 60.75 J * 0.45
    *   **KE ≈ 27.34 Joules**
*   **Muzzle Velocity Calculation:**
    *   KE = ½mv²  =>  v = √(2 * KE / m)
    *   v = √(2 * 27.34 J / 0.0071 kg)
    *   v = √(54.68 / 0.0071)
    *   v = √7691
    *   **v ≈ 87.7 m/s (or ~288 fps)**

#### **3.3 Superiority Analysis**

A competing, non-optimized design might use non-tapered bands and a heavier leather pouch (1.5g). With the same draw weight, its efficiency would be closer to 30%.

*   **Competitor KE:** 60.75 J * 0.30 = 18.23 J
*   **Competitor Velocity:** √(2 * 18.23 J / 0.0071 kg) ≈ **71.6 m/s**

Project Javelin's design choices result in a **~22% increase in projectile velocity** and a **~50% increase in kinetic energy** over a standard configuration with the same draw force, demonstrating clear quantitative superiority.

### **4.0 Conclusion**

Project "Javelin" represents a systematic, physics-based approach to slingshot design. Every component, from the material selection of the frame to the precise taper of the bands, has been chosen and dimensioned to contribute to the dual goals of power and precision. The OTT configuration provides an inherently stable and accurate platform, while the meticulously optimized power system ensures that a greater percentage of the user's input energy is converted into projectile kinetic energy. The projected output of 27.3 Joules and a velocity of 87.7 m/s place this design in the highest echelon of performance, ready for the most rigorous competitive evaluation.
