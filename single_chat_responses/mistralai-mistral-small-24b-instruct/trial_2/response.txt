### 7. Quantitative Engineering Analysis

#### Energy Transfer and Force Output

1. **Elastic Potential Energy**:
   - The elastic potential energy stored in the bands can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
     \]
     where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( x \) is the displacement.
   - For latex rubber bands, the spring constant \( k \) can be approximated as:
     \[
     k = \frac{AE}{L}
     \]
     where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area, \( E \) is the elastic modulus, and \( L \) is the original length.
   - Given \( A = 25 \times 2 = 50 \) mm², \( E = 1.5 \) MPa, and \( L = 200 \) mm:
     \[
     k = \frac{50 \times 1.5 \times 10^6}{200} = 375 \text{ N/m}
     \]
   - Assuming a displacement \( x = 100 \) mm:
     \[
     U = \frac{1}{2} \times 375 \times (0.1)^2 = 1.875 \text{ J}
     \]

2. **Force Output**:
   - The force exerted by the bands can be calculated as:
     \[
     F = kx
     \]
   - For \( k = 375 \) N/m and \( x = 0.1 \) m:
     \[
     F = 375 \times 0.1 = 37.5 \text{ N}
     \]

3. **Projectile Velocity**:
   - The velocity of the projectile can be estimated using the conservation of energy:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = U
     \]
     where \( m \) is the mass of the projectile and \( v \) is the velocity.
   - For \( m = 5 \) grams (0.005 kg) and \( U = 1.875 \) J:
     \[
     v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1.875}{0.005}} \approx 28 \text{ m/s}
     \]

4. **Range and Accuracy**:
   - The range can be estimated using projectile motion equations:
     \[
     R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
     \]
     where \( \theta \) is the launch angle and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²).
   - Assuming an optimal launch angle \( \theta = 45^\circ \):
     \[
     R = \frac{28^2 \sin(90^\circ)}{9.81} \approx 80 \text{ m}
     \]
   - Accuracy can be enhanced by ensuring a consistent launch angle and minimizing vibrations in the frame.
