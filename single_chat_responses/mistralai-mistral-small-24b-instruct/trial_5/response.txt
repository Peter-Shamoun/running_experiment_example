### 7. Quantitative Engineering Analysis

#### Energy Transfer:
- **Potential Energy Stored in Elastic Bands**:
  \[
  U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
  \]
  where \( k \) is the spring constant and \( x \) is the displacement.
  - **Spring Constant (k)**: 50 N/m (estimated based on material properties and dimensions)
  - **Displacement (x)**: 100 mm (0.1 m)
  - **Potential Energy**:
    \[
    U = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.25 \, \text{J}
    \]

#### Force Output:
- **Force Exerted by Elastic Bands**:
  \[
  F = k x
  \]
  - **Force**:
    \[
    F = 50 \times 0.1 = 5 \, \text{N}
    \]

#### Range and Accuracy:
- **Range**:
  \[
  R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
  \]
  where \( v \) is the initial velocity, \( \theta \) is the launch angle, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²).
  - **Initial Velocity (v)**: 20 m/s (estimated based on energy transfer and projectile weight)
  - **Launch Angle (θ)**: 45° (optimal for maximum range)
  - **Range**:
    \[
    R = \frac{(20)^2 \sin(90)}{9.81} \approx 40.8 \, \text{m}
    \]

- **Accuracy**:
  - **Aerodynamic Stability**: Ensured by the projectile's design and material.
  - **Consistent Launch Angle**: Achieved through precise manufacturing and user training.

### 8. Conclusion

This design proposal outlines a high-performance slingshot with optimized energy transfer, range, and accuracy. The use of high-strength aluminum for the frame, latex rubber for the elastic bands, nylon for the pocket, and HDPE for the projectiles ensures durability and performance. The quantitative analysis demonstrates the slingshot's capability to achieve a range of approximately 40.8 meters with a launch angle of 45 degrees, making it a strong contender in the competition.
