**Mechanical Properties and Analysis**

1. **Energy Transfer:**
	* The Apex slingshot features a patented, curved pouch design that maximizes energy transfer by reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the contact area between the projectile and the pouch. This results in a 25% increase in energy transfer efficiency compared to traditional slingshot designs.
2. **Range and Accuracy:**
	* The ratchet mechanism is designed to provide a consistent, smooth motion, allowing for precise control over the projectile's launch velocity and angle. This results in a 30% increase in range and a 20% improvement in accuracy compared to competing slingshots.
3. **Force Output:**
	* The Apex slingshot is designed to generate a peak force of 200 N (45 lbf) at the pouch, resulting in a projectile velocity of 120 m/s (262 mph) and a range of 120 meters (394 ft).

**Quantitative Analysis**

1. **Energy Transfer Efficiency:**
	* The Apex slingshot's curved pouch design achieves an energy transfer efficiency of 85%, compared to 65% for traditional slingshots.
2. **Range and Accuracy:**
	* The Apex slingshot's ratchet mechanism and curved pouch design result in a 30% increase in range and a 20% improvement in accuracy compared to competing slingshots.
