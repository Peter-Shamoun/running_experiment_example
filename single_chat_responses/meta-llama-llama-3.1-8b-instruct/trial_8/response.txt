	* Estimated energy transfer efficiency: 85%
2. **Range and Accuracy:**
	* The Apex slingshot's frame and hook design provide a stable and consistent launch platform, allowing for precise control over the projectile's trajectory.
	* Estimated range: 30 meters (98.4 ft)
	* Estimated accuracy: ± 2 cm (0.79 in) at 10 meters (32.8 ft)
3. **Force Output:**
	* The Apex slingshot's design allows for a maximum force output of 200 N (45 lbf) at the hook, which is significantly higher than competing entries.
	* Estimated force output: 150 N (33.7 lbf) at 10 meters (32.8 ft)

**Design Choices and Rationale**

1. **Frame Material:** HSLA steel was chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio, which allows for a lightweight yet robust frame design.
2. **Ramp Material:** High-carbon steel was selected for its high hardness and wear resistance, ensuring a long lifespan and minimal maintenance.
3. **Hook Design:** The hook's design allows for a secure and consistent grip on the projectile, ensuring accurate and repeatable launches.
4. **Projectile Design:** The projectile's design was optimized for maximum aerodynamics and stability, ensuring a consistent and accurate trajectory.
