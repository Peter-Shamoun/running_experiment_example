**Design Features and Configurations**

1. **Pouch Angle:** The pouch is angled at 30° to optimize the trajectory of the projectile, ensuring a more efficient energy transfer and reduced air resistance.
2. **Band Tension:** The band is pre-tensioned to 100 N (22.5 lbf) to achieve the optimal balance between power and precision.
3. **Frame Reinforcement:** The frame is reinforced with CFRP strips to enhance its structural integrity and reduce the risk of damage.
4. **Pouch Material:** The Kevlar pouch provides excellent abrasion resistance and helps to maintain the projectile's velocity and accuracy.

**Quantitative Analysis**

**Energy Transfer:**

1. **Kinetic Energy (KE) Calculation:** The KE of the projectile is calculated using the formula: KE = (1/2) \* m \* v^2, where m is the mass of the projectile and v is its velocity.
2. **Velocity Calculation:** The velocity of the projectile is calculated using the equation: v = √(2 \* E / m), where E is the energy stored in the band.

**Range and Accuracy Assessments:**

1. **Range Calculation:** The range of the slingshot is calculated using the equation: R = (v^2 \* sin(2θ)) / g, where θ is the angle of projection and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
2. **Accuracy Calculation:** The accuracy of the slingshot is assessed using the standard deviation of the projectile's trajectory, which is calculated using the equation: σ = (v^2 \* sin(θ) \* Δθ) / (2 \* g), where Δθ is the angular spread of the projectile.

**Force Output:**

1. **Force Calculation:** The force output of the slingshot is calculated using the equation: F = (E / d), where E is the energy stored in the band and d is the distance over which the force is applied.

**Performance Estimates:**

1. **Range:** 50 meters (164 ft)
2. **Accuracy:** ± 2 cm (0.8 in)
3. **Force Output:** 200 N (45 lbf)
