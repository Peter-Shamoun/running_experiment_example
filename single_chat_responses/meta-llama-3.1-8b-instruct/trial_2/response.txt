**Material Specifications and Mechanical Properties**

| Material | Young's Modulus (GPa) | Yield Strength (MPa) | Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HSLA Steel (ASTM A36) | 200 | 250 | 400 |
| HDPE | 1.5 | 20 | 30 |

**Quantitative Analysis**

**Force Output**

To estimate the force output of the Apex slingshot, we will use the following assumptions:

* The ratchet and pawl system provides a mechanical advantage of 3:1.
* The sling is made of a high-strength material with a Young's modulus of 200 GPa.
* The projectile is a standard 12 mm (0.47 in) diameter steel ball.

Using the equation for force output (F = (m \* v^2) / (2 \* r)), where m is the mass of the projectile, v is the velocity of the projectile, and r is the radius of the projectile, we can estimate the force output of the Apex slingshot.

Assuming a projectile mass of 12 g (0.43 oz) and a velocity of 100 m/s (328 ft/s), we can calculate the force output as follows:

F = (0.012 kg \* (100 m/s)^2) / (2 \* 0.006 m) ≈ 1000 N (224 lbf)

**Range and Accuracy Assessments**

To evaluate the range and accuracy of the Apex slingshot, we will use the following assumptions:

* The projectile is launched at an angle of 45°.
* The air resistance is negligible.
* The gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/s^2 (32.2 ft/s^2).

Using the equation for range (R = (v^2 \* sin(2θ)) / g), where R is the range, v is the velocity of the projectile, θ is the launch angle, and g is the gravitational acceleration, we can estimate the range of the Apex slingshot.

Assuming a projectile velocity of 100 m/s (328 ft/s) and a launch angle of 45°, we can calculate the range as follows:

R = (100 m/s)^2 \* sin(2 \* 45°) / 9.81 m/s^2 ≈ 50 m (164 ft)

**Projectile Design**

To optimize the performance of the Apex slingshot, we will design a custom projectile with the following specifications:

* Material: High-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel (ASTM A36).
* Dimensions:
	+ Diameter: 12 mm (0.47 in)
	+ Length: 20 mm (0.79 in)
	+ Weight: 12 g (0.43 oz)

The custom projectile design will provide a higher mass-to-diameter ratio, resulting in a higher force output and a longer range.

**Conclusion**

The Apex slingshot design proposal presents a comprehensive and optimized solution for a high-performance slingshot. The use of advanced materials and precise dimensions ensures exceptional power and accuracy. The quantitative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the Apex slingshot, with an estimated force output of 1000 N (224 lbf) and a range of 50 m (164 ft). The custom projectile design further enhances the performance of the Apex slingshot, making it an ideal choice for competitive target shooting and small game hunting.
