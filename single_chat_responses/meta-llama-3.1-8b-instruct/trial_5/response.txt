**Quantitative Analysis**

To evaluate the performance of the Apex slingshot, we will conduct a series of simulations and experiments.

1. **Energy Transfer Analysis:**
	* We will use finite element analysis (FEA) to model the slingshot's frame, pouch, and ratchet/pawl system.
	* The simulation will calculate the energy transfer from the elastic potential energy stored in the slingshot's frame to the kinetic energy of the projectile.
2. **Range and Accuracy Assessments:**
	* We will conduct a series of experiments using a high-speed camera to capture the projectile's trajectory.
	* The experiments will be performed at various distances (10-50 meters) and angles (0-45Â°).
	* The data will be analyzed to determine the slingshot's range and accuracy.
3. **Force Output Analysis:**
	* We will use a load cell to measure the force output of the slingshot at various distances and angles.
	* The data will be analyzed to determine the slingshot's force output and its relationship to the projectile's velocity.

**Estimates for Force Output**

Based on the design and material specifications, we estimate the force output of the Apex slingshot to be:

* Maximum force output: 150 N (33.7 lbf)
* Average force output: 100 N (22.5 lbf)
* Minimum force output: 50 N (11.2 lbf)

**Projectile Specifications**

* Material: High-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel (ASTM A36)
* Dimensions:
	+ Length: 20 mm (0.79 in)
	+ Diameter: 10 mm (0.39 in)
* Mass: 10 g (0.35 oz)

**Projectile Velocity and Range Estimates**

Based on the force output and projectile specifications, we estimate the projectile's velocity and range to be:

* Maximum velocity: 120 m/s (264 ft/s)
* Average velocity: 90 m/s (198 ft/s)
* Minimum velocity: 60 m/s (132 ft/s)
* Maximum range: 50 meters (164 ft)
* Average range: 30 meters (98 ft)
* Minimum range: 10 meters (33 ft)

**Conclusion**
