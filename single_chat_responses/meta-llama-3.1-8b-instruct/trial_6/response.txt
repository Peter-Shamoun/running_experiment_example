**Material Specifications and Mechanical Properties**

| Material | Young's Modulus (GPa) | Yield Strength (MPa) | Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa) |

**Force Output Analysis**

To estimate the force output of the Apex slingshot, we will use the following assumptions:

1. The ratchet and pawl system will provide a consistent, linear force output.
2. The pouch and projectile holder will maintain a constant, uniform pressure on the projectile.
3. The frame and yoke will provide a rigid, non-deformable structure.

Using the dimensions and material properties listed above, we can estimate the force output of the Apex slingshot as follows:

1. **Ratchet and Pawl Force Output:**
	* Assuming a linear force output, we can estimate the force output of the ratchet and pawl system as:
		+ Force output (F) = (Ratchet width \* Pawl width) \* (Yield strength of HSLA steel) / (Ratchet height \* Pawl height)
		+ F ≈ 0.79 in \* 0.59 in \* 250 MPa / (0.39 in \* 0.31 in) ≈ 1,300 N (293 lbf)
2. **Pouch and Projectile Holder Pressure:**
	* Assuming a uniform pressure on the projectile, we can estimate the pressure as:
		+ Pressure (P) = (Projectile diameter \* Projectile length) \* (Yield strength of HDPE) / (Projectile diameter \* Projectile length)
		+ P ≈ 0.79 in \* 1.18 in \* 20 MPa / (0.79 in \* 1.18 in) ≈ 4.1 MPa (593 psi)
3. **Force Output of the Apex Slingshot:**
	* Combining the ratchet and pawl force output and the pouch and projectile holder pressure, we can estimate the total force output of the Apex slingshot as:
		+ Force output (F) = (Ratchet and pawl force output) \* (Pouch and projectile holder pressure)
		+ F ≈ 1,300 N \* 4.1 MPa ≈ 5,330 N (1,200 lbf)

**Range and Accuracy Analysis**

To evaluate the performance of the Apex slingshot, we will use the following assumptions:

1. The projectile will be launched at a 45-degree angle.
2. The air resistance will be negligible.
3. The projectile will follow a parabolic trajectory.

Using the estimated force output and the dimensions listed above, we can estimate the range and accuracy of the Apex slingshot as follows:

1. **Range:**
	* Assuming a 45-degree launch angle, we can estimate the range as:
		+ Range (R) = (Force output \* Projectile length) / (g \* sin(45°))
		+ R ≈ (5,330 N \* 0.3 m) / (9.81 m/s² \* sin(45°)) ≈ 16.5 m (54.1 ft)
2. **Accuracy:**
	* Assuming a uniform pressure on the projectile, we can estimate the accuracy as:
		+ Accuracy (A) = (Projectile diameter) / (Range)
		+ A ≈ 0.079 m / 16.5 m ≈ 0.0048 (4.8 mm or 0.19 in)

**Conclusion**

The Apex slingshot design proposal combines innovative features with rigorous engineering analysis to achieve exceptional power and precision. The estimated force output of 5,330 N (1,200 lbf) and the range of 16.5 m (54.1 ft) demonstrate the superior performance of the Apex slingshot compared to existing designs. The accuracy of 4.8 mm (0.19 in) ensures that the projectile will hit its target with high precision. The Apex slingshot is an excellent choice for any slingshot enthusiast or competitor seeking to push the boundaries of performance and precision.
