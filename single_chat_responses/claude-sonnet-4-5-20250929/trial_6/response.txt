## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Optimal Material**: Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)

**Material Properties**:
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65 mm
- Width: 25 mm (tapered to 20 mm at pouch)
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³
- Elongation at break: 650-700%
- Tensile strength: 25-30 MPa
- Elastic modulus (initial): 1.5-2.0 MPa

### 2.2 Band Geometry
**Configuration**: Dual-band parallel system

**Dimensions per band**:
- Active length: 200 mm (relaxed state)
- Draw length: 600 mm (300% elongation)
- Effective draw: 400 mm
- Taper ratio: 1.25:1 (fork to pouch)

**Energy Storage Calculation**:

For latex rubber, stress-strain relationship (simplified):
```
σ = E × ε (for ε < 300%)
Where E ≈ 1.8 MPa for natural latex

Strain: ε = ΔL/L₀ = 400/200 = 2.0 (200%)

Force per band:
F = σ × A = E × ε × (width × thickness)
F = 1.8 MPa × 2.0 × (22.5 mm × 0.65 mm)
F = 3.6 MPa × 14.625 mm²
F = 52.65 N per band

Total force (2 bands): F_total = 105.3 N
```

**Elastic Potential Energy**:
```
For non-linear elastic materials:
U = ∫F dx ≈ (1/2) × F_avg × Δx

Assuming linear approximation (conservative):
U = (1/2) × 105.3 N × 0.4 m = 21.06 J

Actual (accounting for non-linearity, k increases with strain):
U ≈ 25-28 J (realistic estimate)
```

- Surface finish: Polished (Ra < 0.4 μm)

**Geometry**: Sphere (optimal for stability)
- Diameter: 12 mm (1/2 inch)

- Sphericity tolerance: Grade 100 (±2.5 μm)

**Rationale for Sphere**:

### 4.2 Ballistic Coefficient
```
BC = m / (C_d × A)

Where:
- m = 0.007 kg
- C_d = 0.47 (sphere)
- A = π × (0.006)² = 1.131 × 10⁻⁴ m²

BC = 0.007 / (0.47 × 1.131 × 10⁻⁴)
BC = 131.7 kg/m²
```

## 5. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Energy Transfer Efficiency

**Energy Budget**:
```
Stored elastic energy: U_elastic = 26 J (using realistic estimate)

Losses:
1. Band internal damping: 8% → 2.08 J
2. Pouch/projectile friction: 3% → 0.78 J
3. Air resistance during draw: 2% → 0.52 J
4. Frame vibration: 4% → 1.04 J
5. Non-optimal release angle: 3% → 0.78 J

Total losses: 20% → 5.2 J

Kinetic energy transferred: KE = 26 - 5.2 = 20.8 J
```

**Efficiency**: η = 20.8/26 = 80%

### 5.2 Projectile Velocity
```
KE = (1/2) × m × v²
20.8 = (1/2) × 0.007 × v²
v² = 5,942.86
v = 77.1 m/s (277 km/h)
```

### 5.3 Range Calculation

**Assumptions**:
- Launch angle: 35° (optimal for range with drag)
- Launch height: 1.5 m
- Air density: 1.225 kg/m³
- No wind

**Trajectory Analysis** (simplified with drag):

Drag force: F_d = (1/2) × ρ × v² × C_d × A

```
Initial conditions:
v₀ = 77.1 m/s
v₀ₓ = 77.1 × cos(35°) = 63.2 m/s
v₀ᵧ = 77.1 × sin(35°) = 44.2 m/s

Drag deceleration (initial):
a_d = F_d / m = (0.5 × 1.225 × 77.1² × 0.47 × 1.131×10⁻⁴) / 0.007
a_d = 23.4 m/s²

Time to apex (approximate, accounting for drag):
t_apex ≈ v₀ᵧ / (g + a_d×sin(35°)) = 44.2 / (9.81 + 13.4) ≈ 1.9 s

Maximum height:
h_max ≈ 1.5 + (v₀ᵧ² / (2×(g + a_d×sin(35°))))
h_max ≈ 1.5 + 42.3 ≈ 43.8 m

Range (numerical integration required for precision):
Estimated range: 85-95 m
```

**Vacuum range (theoretical maximum)**:
```
R = (v₀² × sin(2θ)) / g = (77.1² × sin(70°)) / 9.81 = 571 m
Drag reduces this by ~85%
```

   - Velocity variation: ±0.5 m/s
   - Angular dispersion: ±1.5°

2. **Band asymmetry**:

   - Lateral deviation: ±0.3°

3. **Projectile manufacturing tolerance**:

```
Combined angular error: σ_θ ≈ 1.8°

Lateral dispersion:
σ_lateral = 50 × tan(1.8°) ≈ 1.57 m

Circular Error Probable (CEP): ~1.2 m at 50 m range
```
