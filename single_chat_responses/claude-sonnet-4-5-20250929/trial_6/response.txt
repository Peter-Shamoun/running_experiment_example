- Fork width (interior): 100mm
- Fork arm angle: 25° from vertical
- Handle length: 150mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm (ergonomic grip)

**Rationale:** The 25° angle optimizes the force vector geometry, allowing 90.6% of elastic force to translate to forward projectile motion (cos 25° = 0.906) while providing adequate clearance.

### 1.2 Material Specification

**Cross-Section:** Rectangular hollow tube
- Outer dimensions: 25mm × 15mm
- Wall thickness: 3mm
- Second moment of area (I): 2,847 mm⁴

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Material Selection
**Latex Rubber Tubing (Natural)**

Properties:
- Elastic Modulus: 1.5-2.0 MPa (low strain)
- Ultimate Tensile Strength: 25-30 MPa
- Maximum Elongation: 800-1000%
- Hysteresis Loss: 15-20% per cycle
- Density: 0.93 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Configuration
**Dual-band parallel system:**
- Tube outer diameter: 12mm
- Tube inner diameter: 8mm
- Wall thickness: 2mm
- Relaxed length per band: 200mm
- Active length (mounted): 180mm per side
- Total system: 2 bands × 360mm = 720mm relaxed length

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: 400mm (from pouch rest position)
- Elongation per band: 200mm → 400mm
- Strain ratio: λ = 400/200 = 2.0 (200% elongation)

**Force-Extension Relationship:**
For latex rubber, using Mooney-Rivlin model (simplified):
F = (2C₁ + 2C₂)(λ - 1/λ²) × A₀

Where:
- C₁ ≈ 0.3 MPa, C₂ ≈ 0.05 MPa (material constants)
- A₀ = cross-sectional area = π(6² - 4²) = 62.8 mm²

F = (0.6 + 0.1)(2.0 - 0.25) × 62.8 = 0.7 × 1.75 × 62.8 = 77N per band

**Total force at full draw:** 2 bands × 77N = 154N

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
For rubber, energy stored:
U = ∫F·dx ≈ (F_avg) × Δx
F_avg = 154N × 0.6 = 92.4N (accounting for non-linear response)
U = 92.4N × 0.4m = **36.96 Joules**

**Accounting for hysteresis (18% loss):**
Available energy = 36.96 × 0.82 = **30.3 Joules**

v² = 7,116
**v = 84.4 m/s (303 km/h)**

**Maximum Range (45° launch angle, neglecting air resistance):**
R = v²sin(2θ)/g = (84.4)²×1/9.81 = **726 meters (theoretical)**

**Realistic Range (with drag):**
Drag coefficient (sphere): C_d = 0.47
Cross-sectional area: A = π(0.006)² = 1.131×10⁻⁴ m²
Reynolds number at launch: Re = ρvD/μ = 1.225×84.4×0.012/1.81×10⁻⁵ = 68,000

Drag force: F_d = ½ρv²C_dA = ½×1.225×(84.4)²×0.47×1.131×10⁻⁴ = 0.246N

Using ballistic coefficient analysis:
**Practical maximum range: 180-220 meters**

**Accuracy Factors:**
- Spin stabilization: Minimal (spherical symmetry)
- Consistency: ±2% velocity variation with proper technique
- Wind drift at 50m (5 m/s crosswind): ~0.8m
