- Tensile Strength: 20 MPa
- Elongation at break: 850%
- Elastic Modulus (initial): 1.5 MPa
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

- Cross-sectional area: 12 mm²

**Taper Design:**

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Length:** 400mm (from pouch rest to full draw)
**Extension Ratio:** λ = (L₀ + draw)/L₀ = 600/200 = 3.0

**Force-Extension Relationship (Mooney-Rivlin model for rubber):**
```
For large deformations:
F = 2A·C₁(λ - 1/λ²)

Where:
A = cross-sectional area = 12 mm²
C₁ = material constant ≈ 0.25 MPa for latex
λ = extension ratio = 3.0

F = 2 × 12 × 0.25 × (3 - 1/9)
F = 6 × 2.889 = 17.3 N per band
Total force (2 bands): 34.6 N
```

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
```
U = ∫F·dx from 0 to draw length

For Mooney-Rivlin:
U = 2A·C₁·L₀[(λ²/2 - 1/2λ) - (1/2 - 1/2)]
U = 2 × 12 × 0.25 × 200 × [(9/2 - 1/6) - 0]
U = 1,200 × 4.333 = 5,200 mJ per band

Total stored energy (2 bands): 10.4 J
```

### 4.2 Optimal Mass Calculation

**Diameter Options & Performance:**

| Diameter (mm) | Mass (g) | Velocity (m/s) | KE (J) | Range (m)* |
|---------------|----------|----------------|--------|------------|
| 8 | 2.1 | 43.2 | 3.9 | 95 |
| 10 | 4.1 | 30.8 | 3.9 | 97 |
| 12 | 7.2 | 25.4 | 3.7 | 89 |
| 14 | 11.3 | 20.6 | 3.4 | 78 |

*45° launch angle, accounting for drag

**Optimal Selection: 10mm diameter (4.1g)**

**Justification:**
- Maximum range potential
- Balanced velocity and momentum
- Optimal energy transfer efficiency (~37%)

### 4.3 Ballistic Performance

**Energy Transfer Efficiency:**
```
η = (m_projectile)/(m_projectile + m_effective_bands)

Effective band mass (1/3 of total moving mass):
m_bands = 2 × (0.92 g/cm³ × 12 mm² × 200mm) / 3
m_bands = 1.47 g

η = 4.1/(4.1 + 1.47) = 0.736 (73.6%)

Accounting for hysteresis (15% loss):
η_actual = 0.736 × 0.85 = 0.626 (62.6%)

Projectile kinetic energy:
KE = 10.4 J × 0.626 = 6.5 J

Velocity: v = √(2·KE/m) = √(2 × 6.5/0.0041) = 56.3 m/s
```

**Drag Correction (more realistic):**
```
Drag coefficient (sphere): C_d = 0.47
Frontal area: A = π(0.005)² = 7.85×10⁻⁵ m²
Air density: ρ = 1.225 kg/m³

Drag force: F_d = 0.5·ρ·C_d·A·v²
At v = 56.3 m/s: F_d = 0.047 N

Deceleration: a = F_d/m = 11.5 m/s²

Effective launch velocity (accounting for acceleration phase drag):
v_eff ≈ 52 m/s
```

### 4.4 Trajectory Analysis

**Maximum Range Calculation (45° launch):**
```
Horizontal range with drag (numerical approximation):
R ≈ (v₀²/g) × sin(2θ) × [1 - (C_d·ρ·A·v₀)/(2mg)]

R ≈ (52²/9.81) × 1.0 × [1 - 0.15]
R ≈ 275.6 × 0.85 = 234 m (theoretical maximum)

Practical range (accounting for release consistency): ~180-200m
```

**Accuracy Factors:**
```
Angular release tolerance: ±0.5°
Horizontal deviation at 100m: ±0.87m

Velocity variation: ±2%
Range variation at 100m: ±4m
```

Peak force on projectile: F = ma = 0.0041 × 3,380 = 13.9 N
```
