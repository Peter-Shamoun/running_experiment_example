## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions

**Y-Frame Configuration:**
- **Handle length:** 200mm
- **Fork height:** 150mm from handle top
- **Fork width (interior):** 80mm
- **Fork arm thickness:** 25mm × 40mm (rectangular cross-section)
- **Fork angle:** 35° from vertical (optimizes band alignment)

**Rationale:** The Y-frame provides:
- Symmetric force distribution
- Minimal torque on wrist during draw
- Clear sight line for aiming
- 35° angle reduces lateral band wear and optimizes force vector alignment

### 1.2 Material Specification

**Primary Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Yield strength: 276 MPa
- Tensile strength: 310 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 68.9 GPa
- Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- Fatigue strength: 96.5 MPa (500M cycles)

**Stress Analysis:**

Maximum band tension: ~200N per side = 400N total

Force component on each fork arm:
- F_lateral = 200N × sin(35°) = 115N
- F_axial = 200N × cos(35°) = 164N

Bending stress at fork base (critical point):
```
σ = M×c/I
M = F_lateral × L = 115N × 0.15m = 17.25 N⋅m
I = (b×h³)/12 = (0.025 × 0.040³)/12 = 1.33×10⁻⁷ m⁴
c = h/2 = 0.020m
σ = 17.25 × 0.020 / 1.33×10⁻⁷ = 2.59 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:** 276 MPa / 2.59 MPa = **106.6** ✓

**Alternative Material: Laminated Hardwood (Competition Class)**
- Species: Hard Maple (Acer saccharum)
- Modulus of Rupture: 108 MPa
- Elastic Modulus: 12.6 GPa
- Density: 0.71 g/cm³
- Dimensions: Same as aluminum, safety factor ~41.7

## 2. ELASTIC SYSTEM DESIGN

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Primary Choice: Theraband Gold (Max Resistance)**

Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65mm
- Width per band: 25mm
- Active length (relaxed): 200mm
- Draw length: 600mm (from pouch to fork)
- Elongation ratio: λ = 600/200 = 3.0 (300%)

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Tensile strength: 20-25 MPa
- Elongation at break: 600-800%
- Elastic modulus (initial): 1.5-2.0 MPa
- Hysteresis loss: ~15-20%

### 2.2 Energy Storage Calculation

**Force-Extension Relationship (Mooney-Rivlin Model):**

For natural latex at moderate strains:
```
σ = 2C₁(λ - 1/λ²)
```
Where C₁ ≈ 0.3 MPa for latex rubber

At λ = 3.0:
```
σ = 2(0.3)(3 - 1/9) = 2(0.3)(2.889) = 1.73 MPa
```

Force per band:
```
F = σ × A = 1.73 MPa × (25mm × 0.65mm) = 1.73×10⁶ Pa × 1.625×10⁻⁵ m²
F = 28.1N per band
```

**Dual-band configuration:** 2 bands per side = 4 bands total
**Total force at full draw:** 4 × 28.1N = **112.4N**

**Stored Elastic Energy:**

For hyperelastic materials:
```
U = ∫F dx = 2nC₁A₀L₀∫(λ - 1/λ²)dλ from 1 to 3

U = 2nC₁A₀L₀[λ²/2 + 1/(2λ²)]|₁³

U = 2(4)(0.3×10⁶)(1.625×10⁻⁵)(0.2)[(9/2 + 1/18) - (1/2 + 1/2)]

U = 7.8[(4.556) - (1.0)] = 7.8 × 3.556 = 27.7J
```

**Accounting for hysteresis (18% loss):**
**Effective energy available:** 27.7J × 0.82 = **22.7J**

### 2.3 Band Attachment System

**Methodology:** Through-hole with retention knot
- Hole diameter: 8mm
- Distance from fork tip: 15mm
- Edge radius: 2mm (stress concentration reduction)

**Stress concentration factor:** K_t ≈ 2.5 (hole in plate under tension)

Local stress at hole:
```
σ_local = K_t × (F/A_net) = 2.5 × (56.2N / (40mm × 25mm - 8mm × 25mm))
σ_local = 2.5 × (56.2 / 800×10⁻⁶) = 176 kPa
```

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications

**Material:** Full-grain leather (vegetable-tanned)

**Attachment:** Tapered band connection
- Band taper: 25mm → 15mm over 30mm length
- Connection: Folded and stitched with polyester thread

### 3.2 Pouch Mechanics

**Purpose:**
- Secure projectile retention during draw
- Smooth release without tumbling
- Minimal mass (reduces energy loss)

**Mass:** ~2.5g (negligible compared to projectile)

**Release dynamics:** Pouch opens when lateral tension drops below retention threshold, occurring naturally at full arm extension when bands align with trajectory.

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Spherical Projectile Specifications

**Material: Steel (1045 Carbon Steel)**

Mechanical Properties:
- Density: 7.85 g/cm³
- Hardness: 55-60 HRC (heat treated)
- Surface: Polished (Ra < 0.4 μm)

**Dimensions:**
- Diameter: 12.7mm (1/2 inch)
- Mass: m = (4/3)πr³ρ = (4/3)π(6.35×10⁻³)³(7850) = **8.4g**

### 4.2 Ballistic Performance Calculations

**Initial Velocity:**

Energy transfer efficiency: η ≈ 85% (accounting for band mass, pouch dynamics)

```
½mv² = η × U_stored
v = √(2ηU/m) = √(2 × 0.85 × 22.7 / 0.0084)
v = √(38.59 / 0.0084) = √4594
v = 67.8 m/s
```

**Maximum Range (45° launch angle, neglecting drag):**

```
R = v²sin(2θ)/g = (67.8)²(1)/9.81 = 468m
```

**With Drag Considerations:**

Drag coefficient (sphere): C_d = 0.47
Cross-sectional area: A = πr² = 1.27×10⁻⁴ m²
Reynolds number: Re = ρvD/μ = (1.225)(67.8)(0.0127)/1.81×10⁻⁵ ≈ 58,000 (turbulent)

Drag force at initial velocity:
```
F_d = ½ρv²C_dA = 0.5(1.225)(67.8)²(0.47)(1.27×10⁻⁴) = 0.175N
```

Deceleration: a = F_d/m = 0.175/0.0084 = 20.8 m/s²

**Realistic range (numerical integration suggests):** ~180-220m

**Effective accurate range:** 30-50m (where wind drift < 100mm)

### 4.3 Alternative Projectile: Clay Sphere

**Material:** Ceramic clay (fired)
- Diameter: 15mm
- Density: 2.0 g/cm³
- Mass: 3.5g

**Velocity:** v = √(2 × 0.85 × 22.7 / 0.0035) = 110.8 m/s

**Advantage:** Higher velocity, flatter trajectory at short range
**Disadvantage:** More affected by drag, lower momentum

### 5.3 Band Symmetry

**Critical Tolerances:**
- Band length matching: ±2mm
- Band width uniformity: ±0.5mm
- Attachment height difference: <1mm

**Impact:** 5mm band length difference causes ~30cm lateral deviation at 30m

**Quality Control:** Pre-stretch bands to 200% for 24h to equalize stress relaxation

```

### 6.2 Band Mass Effect

**Band system mass:**
- 4 bands × 200mm × 25mm × 0.65mm × 1.1 g/cm³ = 14.3g

**Band center-of-mass velocity:** ~0.5 × v_projectile = 34 m/s

**Energy in bands:**
```
E_bands = ½m_bands × v_cm² = 0.5 × 0.0143 × (34)² = 8.3J
```

**Correction:** Bands don't maintain full velocity; effective loss ~1.5J

### 6.3 Optimization Strategies

**To Maximize Efficiency:**

1. **Reduce band mass:** Use thinner bands (0.5mm) with increased width (30mm)
   - Maintains force, reduces mass by 23%
   - Potential velocity increase: 4-5%

2. **Optimize draw length:** 
   - Current: 600mm (λ = 3.0)
   - Extended: 700mm (λ = 3.5) → +35% energy, but diminishing returns
   - Risk: Exceeds safe elongation for durability

3. **Projectile mass optimization:**
   - Lighter (5g): v = 87 m/s, but E = 18.9J (lower impact)
   - Heavier (12g): v = 56 m/s, E = 18.8J (better wind resistance)
   - **Current 8.4g is optimal balance**
