## 1. FRAME DESIGN & STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Frame Geometry
**Y-Fork Configuration with Optimized Dimensions:**

- **Overall height:** 300 mm
- **Fork width (outer):** 120 mm
- **Fork arm angle:** 35° from vertical axis
- **Handle length:** 150 mm
- **Fork arm length:** 150 mm
- **Fork arm cross-section:** 25 mm × 15 mm rectangular

**Rationale:** The 35° angle maximizes elastic band elongation while maintaining structural integrity. This geometry provides 180-200 mm of effective draw length.

### 1.2 Material Specification: Frame

**Primary Material: 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Tensile strength: 572 MPa
- Yield strength: 503 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 71.7 GPa
- Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- Fatigue strength: 159 MPa (at 5×10⁸ cycles)

**Stress Analysis:**
Maximum force during draw: ~200 N
Applied moment at fork junction: M = F × d = 200 N × 0.075 m = 15 N·m

Bending stress: σ = (M × c) / I

Where:
- c = 12.5 mm (distance to neutral axis)
- I = (b × h³)/12 = (15 × 25³)/12 = 19,531 mm⁴

σ = (15,000 N·mm × 12.5 mm) / 19,531 mm⁴ = **9.6 MPa**

**Safety Factor:** 503 MPa / 9.6 MPa = **52.4** (excellent)

**Alternative Material Option: Carbon Fiber Composite**
- If weight reduction is prioritized: UD carbon fiber/epoxy laminate
- Tensile strength: 1,500 MPa
- Modulus: 135 GPa
- Density: 1.55 g/cm³

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Optimal Material: Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65 mm
- Tensile strength: 20-25 MPa
- Elongation at break: 700-850%
- Elastic modulus (at 100% strain): ~1.5 MPa
- Hysteresis loss: ~15-20%

### 2.2 Band Geometry & Configuration

**Tapered Band Design:**

**Active band dimensions (per side):**
- Length (relaxed): 200 mm
- Width at fork attachment: 25 mm
- Width at pouch: 15 mm
- Taper ratio: 1.67:1
- Thickness: 0.65 mm (single layer) or 1.30 mm (double layer)

**Rationale for Taper:**
Tapered design ensures uniform stress distribution along band length, preventing stress concentration at pouch attachment point and maximizing energy storage efficiency.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw length:** 180 mm (from rest position)
**Total elongation:** 200 mm (rest) + 180 mm = 380 mm
**Strain:** ε = (380-200)/200 = **90% elongation**

**Force-Elongation Relationship:**
For latex rubber at moderate strains:
F = A × E × ε

Where:
- A = cross-sectional area (average) = 20 mm × 0.65 mm × 2 bands = 26 mm²
- E = elastic modulus ≈ 1.5 MPa (at this strain range)
- ε = 0.90

**Peak draw force:** F = 26 mm² × 1.5 MPa × 0.90 = **35.1 N**

**More accurate calculation using rubber elasticity:**
For natural rubber, force increases non-linearly:
F ≈ 15 N + (0.22 N/mm × draw distance)
At 180 mm draw: F ≈ 15 + (0.22 × 180) = **54.6 N**

**Elastic Potential Energy Stored:**
Using trapezoidal approximation:
E = ½ × (F_initial + F_final) × displacement
E = ½ × (15 N + 54.6 N) × 0.180 m
E = **6.26 Joules**

**Accounting for hysteresis (18% energy loss):**
Effective energy available: 6.26 J × 0.82 = **5.13 Joules**

**Dimensions:**
- Length: 60 mm
- Width: 40 mm
- Projectile cradle depth: 8 mm (formed)

**Attachment:** Reinforced stitching with 4 mm overlap on each band

**Mass:** ~2.5 grams

**Rationale:** Leather provides optimal friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0.4-0.6) for projectile retention during draw while releasing cleanly. The formed cradle centers the projectile and ensures consistent release angle.

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN & BALLISTICS

### 4.1 Projectile Specifications

**Material: Steel Ball Bearing (AISI 52100)**

**Properties:**
- Diameter: 12 mm (±0.005 mm tolerance)
- Mass: 7.0 grams
- Density: 7.85 g/cm³
- Surface finish: Grade 25 (Ra < 0.5 μm)
- Hardness: 60-67 HRC

**Rationale:** Spherical geometry minimizes drag, high density maximizes momentum, precision manufacturing ensures consistency.

### 4.2 Ballistic Performance Calculations

**Muzzle Velocity Calculation:**

Energy transfer efficiency: η ≈ 85% (accounting for pouch mass and friction)

Kinetic energy imparted to projectile:
KE = 5.13 J × 0.85 = **4.36 Joules**

Velocity: v = √(2×KE/m) = √(2 × 4.36 J / 0.007 kg)
**v = 35.3 m/s (126.9 km/h)**

### 4.3 Range Calculation

**Optimal launch angle:** 35-40° (accounting for release height)

Using projectile motion equations with drag:

**Drag force:** F_d = ½ × ρ × v² × C_d × A

Where:
- ρ = 1.225 kg/m³ (air density)
- C_d = 0.47 (sphere)
- A = π × (0.006 m)² = 1.131 × 10⁻⁴ m²

**Drag coefficient:** k = ½ × ρ × C_d × A = 3.27 × 10⁻⁵

**Ballistic coefficient:** BC = m / (C_d × A) = 0.007 / (0.47 × 1.131×10⁻⁴) = **131.6 kg/m²**

**Numerical integration for 37° launch angle:**

Using simplified drag equation:
Range ≈ (v² / g) × sin(2θ) × [1 - (k×v×range_estimate/mg)]

Iterative solution yields:
**Maximum range: 42-45 meters** (in still air, sea level)

### 4.4 Accuracy Factors

**Projectile consistency:** ±0.005 mm tolerance ensures <0.2° deviation
**Expected grouping at 20m:** 50 mm radius (95% confidence)

**Critical factors:**
1. Release timing consistency: ±2 ms window
2. Band symmetry: <2% force differential
3. Projectile centering: ±0.5 mm in pouch

6. **Projectile kinetic energy: 4.36 J (69.6% overall efficiency)**

### 5.2 Acceleration Profile

**Acceleration distance:** ~180 mm (draw length)
**Average acceleration:** a = v² / (2×s) = (35.3)² / (2×0.18) = **3,463 m/s²** (353 g)
**Acceleration time:** t = v / a = 35.3 / 3463 = **10.2 milliseconds**
**Peak force on projectile:** F = m×a = 0.007 kg × 3463 m/s² = **24.2 N**
