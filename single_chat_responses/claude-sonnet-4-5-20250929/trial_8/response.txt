## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Configuration

**Y-Fork Design with Ergonomic Handle**

**Dimensions:**
- Overall height: 280mm
- Fork width (outer): 120mm
- Fork arm length: 180mm
- Fork arm angle: 35° from vertical
- Handle length: 100mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm

**Rationale:**
- 35° angle optimizes band attachment geometry for maximum draw length while maintaining structural integrity
- 120mm width accommodates 200mm band stretch without interference
- Ergonomic handle diameter (35mm) fits 95th percentile hand grip

### 1.2 Material Specification

**Primary Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Yield Strength: 276 MPa
- Ultimate Tensile Strength: 310 MPa
- Young's Modulus: 68.9 GPa
- Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- Fatigue Strength: 96.5 MPa (at 5×10⁸ cycles)

**Cross-Section:**
- Fork arms: 20mm × 15mm rectangular profile
- Wall thickness: 4mm (hollow construction)
- Mass per arm: ~45g

**Stress Analysis:**

Maximum band tension at full draw: F = 180N (calculated in Section 2)

Bending moment at fork base:
```
M = F × L × sin(θ)
M = 180N × 0.18m × sin(35°)
M = 18.56 N⋅m
```

Bending stress:
```
σ = M × c / I

For rectangular hollow section:
I = (20×15³ - 12×7³)/12 = 5,354 mm⁴
c = 7.5mm

σ = 18,560 N⋅mm × 7.5mm / 5,354 mm⁴
σ = 26.0 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:** 276 MPa / 26.0 MPa = **10.6** ✓

**Alternative Material (Budget Option):**
- Hardwood (Maple): σ_yield = 40-60 MPa, E = 12 GPa
- Required cross-section: 25mm × 20mm solid
- Safety factor: ~2.3 (acceptable)

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

**Material Properties:**
- Composition: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65mm
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³
- Ultimate Tensile Strength: 25 MPa
- Elongation at break: 850%
- Elastic modulus (at 300% strain): ~1.5 MPa

**Rationale:** Natural latex provides superior elastic efficiency (>90% energy return) compared to synthetic rubbers (75-85%).

### 2.2 Band Geometry

**Tapered Configuration:**

**Dimensions:**
- Attachment end width: 40mm
- Pouch end width: 20mm
- Active length (each band): 200mm
- Taper: Linear from 40mm to 20mm over 200mm
- Total thickness: 0.65mm (single layer)

**Rationale for Taper:**
- Uniform stress distribution along band length
- Reduces mass at high-velocity end (pouch)
- Optimizes energy transfer efficiency

**Mass Calculation:**
```
Average width = (40 + 20)/2 = 30mm
Volume per band = 200mm × 30mm × 0.65mm = 3,900 mm³
Mass per band = 3,900 mm³ × 0.92 g/cm³ = 3.59g
Total band mass = 7.18g
```

### 2.3 Force-Extension Analysis

**Stress-Strain Relationship:**

For latex at moderate strains (300-400%):
```
σ = E × ε
where E ≈ 1.5 MPa at 300% strain
```

**Draw Length:** 600mm (from 200mm rest length)
**Strain:** ε = (600-200)/200 = 2.0 = 200%

**Effective Modulus at 200% strain:** ~1.2 MPa (from empirical data)

**Force Calculation:**

Cross-sectional area per band:
```
A_avg = 30mm × 0.65mm = 19.5 mm²
```

Stress at 200% strain:
```
σ = 1.2 MPa × 2.0 = 2.4 MPa
```

Force per band:
```
F_band = σ × A = 2.4 MPa × 19.5 mm² = 46.8N
```

**Total force (two bands):** F_total = 93.6N ≈ **94N**

**Peak force at full draw (accounting for geometric effects):**
```
F_peak = F_total / cos(35°) = 94N / 0.819 = 115N
```

### 2.4 Elastic Potential Energy

**Energy Storage:**
```
For rubber bands, energy is integral of force over distance.
Approximating as linear spring (conservative estimate):

U = ½ k × x²

Effective spring constant:
k = F / x = 94N / 0.4m = 235 N/m

U = ½ × 235 N/m × (0.4m)² = 18.8 J
```

**More accurate (accounting for non-linear behavior):**

For latex, energy density ≈ 1.2 J/g at 200% strain

```
U_actual = 1.2 J/g × 7.18g = 8.6 J
```

**Conservative estimate for calculations: 10J stored energy**

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications

**Material:** Soft leather (vegetable-tanned, 1.5mm thickness)

**Dimensions:**
- Length: 60mm
- Width: 40mm
- Projectile cradle: 25mm diameter circular depression

**Mass:** ~2.5g

**Attachment:** Reinforced stitching with 4mm² contact area per band

### 3.2 Release Mechanism Analysis

**Pouch Release Dynamics:**

Critical angle for projectile release: θ_release ≈ 45° (optimal for range)

**Release consistency:** ±1° (achievable with practice)

**Impact on accuracy:**
```
Δθ = 1° = 0.0175 rad
At 30m range, lateral deviation:
Δy = 30m × tan(0.0175) = 0.52m
```

This meets our ±0.5m accuracy target at the limit.

---

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Spherical Projectile Specifications

**Material:** Lead (for maximum density and consistency)

**Diameter:** 15mm

**Mass Calculation:**
```
Volume = (4/3)π r³ = (4/3)π(7.5mm)³ = 1,767 mm³
Density of lead = 11.34 g/cm³
Mass = 1,767 mm³ × 11.34 g/cm³ = 20.0g
```

**Alternative (Safety/Regulations):** Steel ball bearings
- Diameter: 15mm
- Density: 7.85 g/cm³
- Mass: 13.9g

### 4.2 Projectile Selection Rationale

**Optimal Mass Analysis:**

Energy transfer efficiency depends on mass ratio:

```
η = 4m_p × m_b / (m_p + m_b)²

where:
m_p = projectile mass
m_b = band system mass (7.18g)
```

For lead projectile (20g):
```
η = 4 × 20 × 7.18 / (20 + 7.18)² = 0.78 (78% efficiency)
```

For steel projectile (13.9g):
```
η = 4 × 13.9 × 7.18 / (13.9 + 7.18)² = 0.89 (89% efficiency)
```

**Steel projectile provides superior energy transfer efficiency.**

### 4.3 Aerodynamic Considerations

**Drag Force:**
```
F_d = ½ ρ C_d A v²

where:
ρ = 1.225 kg/m³ (air density)
C_d = 0.47 (sphere)
A = π r² = π(7.5mm)² = 177 mm²
```

**Terminal velocity (steel projectile):**
```
v_terminal = √(2mg / ρ C_d A)
v_terminal = √(2 × 0.0139kg × 9.81 / (1.225 × 0.47 × 0.000177))
v_terminal = 86 m/s
```

Our projectile velocity << terminal velocity, so drag is manageable but significant.

## 5. BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Muzzle Velocity Calculation

**Energy Transfer:**

Stored energy: U = 10J
Transfer efficiency: η = 89%
Kinetic energy imparted: KE = 10J × 0.89 = 8.9J

**Velocity (steel projectile, 13.9g):**
```
KE = ½ m v²
v = √(2 × KE / m)
v = √(2 × 8.9J / 0.0139kg)
v = 35.8 m/s
```

**Muzzle velocity: 35.8 m/s (129 km/h)**

### 5.2 Range Calculation

**Simplified Ballistic Trajectory (45° launch angle):**

Without air resistance:
```
R = v² sin(2θ) / g
R = (35.8)² × sin(90°) / 9.81
R = 130.7 m
```

**With air resistance (numerical approximation):**

Drag coefficient factor:
```
β = ½ ρ C_d A / m
β = 0.5 × 1.225 × 0.47 × 0.000177 / 0.0139
β = 0.0037 m⁻¹
```

Approximate range reduction: 25-30%

**Realistic maximum range: 90-100m**

### 5.3 Accuracy Analysis at 30m

**Launch angle:** 30° (for 30m target)

**Time of flight:**
```
t = 2v sin(θ) / g
t = 2 × 35.8 × sin(30°) / 9.81
t = 3.65 s (approximate, with drag ~2.5s)
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

1. **Velocity variation (±2%):**
   - Δv = ±0.72 m/s
   - Range variation: ±1.2m

2. **Angle variation (±1°):**
   - Lateral deviation: ±0.52m

3. **Mass variation (±0.5g):**
   - Velocity change: ±1.3%
   - Range variation: ±0.8m

**Combined RSS uncertainty:** ±1.5m at 30m

**Mitigation:** Consistent projectiles (ball bearings), practiced release technique
