## 1. FRAME DESIGN & STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Frame Geometry
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- **Material:** 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy
  - Yield Strength: 276 MPa
  - Elastic Modulus: 68.9 GPa
  - Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- **Dimensions:**
  - Handle length: 150 mm
  - Fork arm length: 120 mm
  - Fork angle: 35° from centerline (70° total spread)
  - Handle diameter: 32 mm
  - Fork arm diameter: 25 mm (tapered to 20 mm at tips)

**Rationale:** The 70° fork spread optimizes the force vector geometry. At full draw, elastic bands form ~60° angle with projectile trajectory, yielding 86.6% forward force efficiency (cos 30°). Aluminum provides excellent strength-to-weight ratio (102 kN·m/kg) while minimizing frame mass that doesn't contribute to projectile energy.

### 1.2 Structural Loading Analysis
**Maximum Band Tension:** 400 N (200 N per band at full draw)

**Bending Moment at Fork Junction:**
```
M = F × L × sin(θ)
M = 200 N × 0.12 m × sin(35°) = 13.8 N·m
```

**Bending Stress:**
```
σ = (M × c) / I
For circular cross-section: I = πd⁴/64 = π(0.025)⁴/64 = 1.92×10⁻⁸ m⁴
σ = (13.8 × 0.0125) / (1.92×10⁻⁸) = 8.98 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:** 276 MPa / 8.98 MPa = **30.7** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Material:** Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)
- **Mechanical Properties:**
  - Tensile Strength: 20 MPa
  - Elongation at Break: 850%
  - Elastic Modulus (initial): 1.5 MPa
  - Hysteresis Loss: ~15%
  - Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Dimensions (Per Side)
**Tapered Configuration:**
- **Attachment end (fork):** 40 mm width × 1.5 mm thickness
- **Pouch end:** 20 mm width × 1.5 mm thickness
- **Active length:** 200 mm
- **Taper:** Linear reduction over full length

**Rationale:** Tapered design ensures uniform stress distribution along band length, preventing premature failure at high-stress concentration points. This maximizes energy storage while maintaining reliability.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Length:** 300 mm (from rest position)

**Elongation Ratio:**
```
λ = (L₀ + ΔL) / L₀ = (200 + 300) / 200 = 2.5 (250% elongation)
```

**Force-Extension Relationship (Mooney-Rivlin Model for Rubber):**
For simplified analysis using average cross-section:
```
A_avg = [(40 + 20)/2] × 1.5 = 45 mm²
```

**Stress at 250% elongation (from empirical latex data):**
```
σ ≈ 4.5 MPa at λ = 2.5
```

**Force per band:**
```
F = σ × A = 4.5 MPa × 45 mm² = 202.5 N ≈ 200 N
```

**Elastic Potential Energy (both bands):**
```
U = 2 × ∫F dx
For rubber approximation: U ≈ (F_avg × ΔL)
U ≈ 2 × (100 N × 0.3 m) = 60 J
```

**Accounting for hysteresis (15% loss):**
```
U_effective = 60 J × 0.85 = 51 J
```

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications
- **Material:** Vegetable-tanned leather (3 mm thickness)
- **Dimensions:** 50 mm × 40 mm rectangular
- **Projectile cup depth:** 8 mm
- **Attachment:** Reinforced holes with brass grommets (4 mm ID)

**Rationale:** Leather provides optimal friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0.6) for projectile retention during acceleration while releasing cleanly. Cup depth prevents premature release while allowing consistent exit trajectory.

### 3.2 Release Dynamics
**Projectile Retention Force Required:**
```
F_retention = m × a × μ
For 20g projectile at 200 m/s² average acceleration:
F_retention = 0.02 kg × 200 m/s² × 0.6 = 2.4 N
```

This is easily maintained until full band extension, ensuring controlled release.

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Spherical Projectile Specifications
**Material:** Lead (for maximum density)
- **Density:** 11.34 g/cm³
- **Diameter:** 12 mm
- **Mass:** 
```
m = ρ × V = ρ × (4/3)πr³
m = 11.34 × (4/3) × π × (0.006)³ = 10.2 g
```

**Alternative (for safety/regulations):** Steel ball bearings
- **Density:** 7.85 g/cm³
- **Diameter:** 12 mm
- **Mass:** 7.1 g

### 4.2 Projectile Selection Rationale

**Spherical geometry advantages:**
1. **Uniform mass distribution** → stable flight
2. **Minimal drag coefficient** (C_d ≈ 0.47 for sphere)
3. **Consistent contact with pouch** → reproducible release
4. **No orientation dependency** → eliminates variable

## 5. BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Muzzle Velocity Calculation

**Energy Transfer Efficiency:** 
- Band hysteresis loss: 15%
- Pouch/projectile friction: 3%
- Air resistance during draw: 2%
- **Total efficiency: 80%**

**Kinetic Energy Imparted (10.2g lead projectile):**
```
KE = U_effective × η = 51 J × 0.80 = 40.8 J
```

**Muzzle Velocity:**
```
v = √(2×KE/m) = √(2 × 40.8 / 0.0102) = 89.4 m/s
```

**For 7.1g steel projectile:**
```
v = √(2 × 40.8 / 0.0071) = 107.2 m/s
```

### 5.2 Maximum Range Calculation

**Optimal Launch Angle:** 45° (neglecting air resistance initially)

**Range Formula (vacuum):**
```
R = v² sin(2θ) / g
R = (89.4)² × sin(90°) / 9.81 = 815 m (lead, theoretical)
```

**Accounting for Drag:**

**Reynolds Number:**
```
Re = (ρ_air × v × d) / μ_air
Re = (1.225 × 89.4 × 0.012) / (1.81×10⁻⁵) = 72,500
```

At this Re, C_d ≈ 0.47 for smooth sphere.

**Drag Force:**
```
F_d = 0.5 × ρ × v² × C_d × A
F_d = 0.5 × 1.225 × (89.4)² × 0.47 × π(0.006)²
F_d = 0.276 N (at muzzle velocity)
```

**Ballistic Coefficient:**
```
BC = m / (C_d × A) = 0.0102 / (0.47 × 1.131×10⁻⁴) = 192 kg/m²
```

**Realistic Range (using ballistic calculator approximation):**
```
R_actual ≈ 120-150 m (lead projectile, 45° launch)
```

### 5.3 Accuracy Factors

**Consistency Requirements:**
1. **Band elongation uniformity:** ±2 mm → ±2.2% velocity variation
2. **Projectile mass tolerance:** ±0.1 g → ±1% velocity variation
3. **Release timing:** ±0.001 s → ±0.5° angular deviation

**Expected Grouping at 30m:**
```
Combined error: √(2.2² + 1² + 0.5²) ≈ 2.5%
Dispersion: 30 m × tan(2.5°) ≈ 1.3 m radius
```

**Optimization:** Precision manufacturing and consistent draw technique can reduce to <0.5 m radius.

## 6. AIMING SYSTEM

### 6.1 Sight Design
**Configuration:** Adjustable rear notch + fixed front post

**Specifications:**
- **Front post height:** 15 mm above frame centerline
- **Rear notch position:** 100 mm behind pouch rest position
- **Sight radius:** 100 mm
- **Adjustment:** Windage and elevation screws (0.5 mm per click)

**Angular Resolution:**
```
θ_min = sight_adjustment / sight_radius
θ_min = 0.5 mm / 100 mm = 0.005 rad = 0.29°
```

**Downrange adjustment at 30m:**
```
Δy = 30 m × tan(0.29°) = 0.15 m per click
```

### 6.2 Trajectory Compensation

**Drop at 30m (lead projectile, 89.4 m/s, 0° launch):**

**Time of flight:**
```
t = distance / v_horizontal ≈ 30 / 89.4 = 0.336 s
```

**Vertical drop:**
```
y = 0.5 × g × t² = 0.5 × 9.81 × (0.336)² = 0.55 m
```

**Required elevation angle:**
```
θ = arctan(0.55/30) = 1.05°
```

**Sight adjustment:** Front post should be 1.8 mm above bore axis for 30m zero.

## 7. ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION FEATURES

### 7.1 Band Attachment System
**Design:** Recessed aluminum clamp with radius matching band curvature

**Specifications:**
- **Clamp width:** 45 mm
- **Clamping surface radius:** 12.5 mm (matching fork arm)
- **Bolt torque:** 5 N·m (M5 stainless steel)
- **Contact pressure:** 
```
P = F / A = (5 N·m / 0.004 m) / (0.045 × 0.025) = 1.11 MPa
```

**Rationale:** Distributed clamping pressure prevents stress concentration and band tearing. Radius matching eliminates sharp bending that causes premature failure.

### 7.2 Stabilization Features

**Wrist Brace:**
- **Material:** Carbon fiber composite
- **Dimensions:** 80 mm length, contoured to forearm
- **Attachment:** Two M6 bolts to handle base

**Benefit:** Reduces wrist rotation variance by 75%, improving consistency.

**Moment Resistance:**
```
Torque from band tension = 200 N × 0.15 m = 30 N·m
Brace moment arm = 0.08 m
Required force on forearm = 30 / 0.08 = 375 N (easily provided by contact)
```
