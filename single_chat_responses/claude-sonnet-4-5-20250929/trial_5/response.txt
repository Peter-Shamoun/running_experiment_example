## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- Overall height: 300mm
- Fork width (interior): 100mm
- Fork arm angle: 25° from vertical
- Handle length: 150mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm (ergonomic grip)

**Rationale:** The 25° angle optimizes the force vector resolution during full draw while maintaining structural integrity. Wider angles reduce effective elastic force; narrower angles risk band interference.

### 1.2 Material Selection
**Primary Structure: 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile Strength: 572 MPa
- Yield Strength: 503 MPa
- Elastic Modulus: 71.7 GPa
- Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- Fatigue Strength: 159 MPa (5×10⁸ cycles)

**Justification:**
- High strength-to-weight ratio (203,000 N·m/kg)
- Excellent fatigue resistance for repeated loading
- Machinability for precision manufacturing
- Superior to steel (unnecessary weight) and polymer composites (creep under sustained load)

### 1.3 Structural Analysis
**Cross-Section:** Hollow rectangular tube (40mm × 25mm × 3mm wall)

**Bending Stress Calculation:**
At maximum draw force (F = 200N per band, total 400N):
- Moment arm: 50mm (half fork width)
- Bending moment: M = 400N × 0.05m = 20 N·m
- Section modulus: I/c ≈ 8.2 × 10⁻⁹ m³
- Maximum stress: σ = M/(I/c) = 20/8.2×10⁻⁹ = 2.44 MPa

**Safety Factor:** 503 MPa / 2.44 MPa = **206** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC SYSTEM DESIGN

### 2.1 Band Material
**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

Mechanical Properties:
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65mm
- Width (active): 20mm tapering to 15mm
- Active length: 200mm per side
- Elastic modulus: ~1.5 MPa (at 300% strain)
- Maximum elongation: 600-800%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Configuration
**Tapered Design:**
- Attachment end: 25mm width
- Pouch end: 15mm width
- Taper length: 200mm

**Rationale:** Tapered geometry distributes stress more uniformly, reducing stress concentration at the pouch attachment point. This increases band longevity and reduces premature failure.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: L = 600mm (from rest to full draw)
- Elongation: ε = (600-200)/200 = 200% strain
- Operating within safe elastic limit (<600% failure strain)

**Force-Extension Relationship:**
For latex rubber (non-linear elastic):
F = k₁·x + k₂·x²

Where:
- k₁ ≈ 0.5 N/mm (linear component)
- k₂ ≈ 0.001 N/mm² (non-linear component)

At 400mm extension:
F = 0.5(400) + 0.001(400)² = 200 + 160 = **360N total force**

**Stored Elastic Energy:**
E = ∫F·dx = k₁x²/2 + k₂x³/3

E = 0.5(400)²/2 + 0.001(400)³/3
E = 40,000 + 21,333 = **61.3 Joules**

### 2.4 Dual-Band Configuration
Using two parallel bands:
- Total stored energy: **122.6 Joules**
- Peak draw force: **720N** (manageable for adult user)

**Attachment:** Reinforced double-fold with polyester thread (breaking strength: 15kg per strand, 4 strands = 60kg capacity)

### 3.2 Release Mechanics
**Pouch separation angle at release:** 15-20°

This angle ensures:
- Minimal lateral force component
- Symmetric release (critical for accuracy)
- Complete projectile separation within 5mm of release point

Drag force: Fd = ½ρCdAv²
- ρ (air density): 1.225 kg/m³
- A (cross-section): π(0.006)² = 1.13×10⁻⁴ m²
