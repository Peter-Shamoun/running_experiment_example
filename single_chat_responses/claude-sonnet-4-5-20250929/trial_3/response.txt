## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- Overall height: 300mm
- Fork width (outer): 120mm
- Fork arm length: 180mm
- Fork arm angle: 35° from vertical
- Handle length: 120mm
- Handle diameter: 32mm

**Rationale:** 35° angle optimizes the force vector geometry, allowing 86% of elastic force to translate into forward projectile motion (cos 35° ≈ 0.82 per arm, combined vector efficiency ~86%).

### 1.2 Material Specification
**Primary Material: 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile strength: 572 MPa
- Yield strength: 503 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 71.7 GPa
- Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- Fatigue strength: 159 MPa (5×10⁸ cycles)

**Cross-section:** Hollow rectangular tube 25mm × 15mm, wall thickness 3mm

**Stress Analysis:**
- Maximum band tension: 200N per side (400N total)
- Moment arm at fork junction: 90mm
- Bending moment: M = 200N × 0.09m = 18 N·m
- Section modulus: I/c ≈ 1.47 × 10⁻⁶ m³
- Maximum bending stress: σ = M/(I/c) = 12.2 MPa
- **Safety factor: 503/12.2 ≈ 41** ✓

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

Material Properties:
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65mm
- Elastic modulus: 1.5-2.0 MPa (non-linear)
- Ultimate tensile strength: 25 MPa
- Maximum elongation: 700-800%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Dimensions
**Tapered Design:**
- Attachment end width: 25mm
- Pouch end width: 15mm
- Active length per side: 200mm
- Taper angle: 2.86°

**Rationale:** Tapered design ensures uniform stress distribution along band length, preventing premature failure at high-stress points. Mass reduction toward pouch end minimizes parasitic kinetic energy loss.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: 600mm (from rest position)
- Effective elongation: 600mm - 200mm = 400mm
- Strain: ε = 400/200 = 2.0 (200% elongation)

**Force-Extension Relationship (Empirical Model):**
For latex at moderate strains:
F = A × t × E × ε × (1 + k×ε²)

Where:
- A = average width = 20mm = 0.02m
- t = thickness = 0.65mm = 0.00065m
- E = elastic modulus ≈ 1.75 MPa
- k = non-linearity coefficient ≈ 0.3
- ε = 2.0

F = 0.02 × 0.00065 × 1.75×10⁶ × 2.0 × (1 + 0.3×4)
F ≈ 45.5 × 2.2 ≈ **100N per band**

**Total force at full draw: 200N**

**Stored Elastic Energy:**
For non-linear elastic:
U = ∫F dx ≈ (1/2) × F_avg × Δx

F_avg ≈ 100N (accounting for non-linear curve)
U = 0.5 × 200N × 0.4m = **40 Joules**

- Smooth edges prevent premature release

---

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Specifications
**Material: Lead-free solder spheres (96.5% Tin, 3.5% Silver)**

Properties:
- Density: 7.37 g/cm³
- Diameter: 12mm
- Mass: m = (4/3)πr³ρ = (4/3)π(0.006)³×7370 = **6.65g**

**Surface Treatment:** Polished to Ra < 0.4μm for aerodynamic efficiency

### 4.2 Ballistic Coefficient
BC = m / (C_d × A)

Where:
- C_d ≈ 0.47 (sphere)
- A = πr² = π(0.006)² = 1.13×10⁻⁴ m²

BC = 0.00665 / (0.47 × 1.13×10⁻⁴) = **125 kg/m²**
