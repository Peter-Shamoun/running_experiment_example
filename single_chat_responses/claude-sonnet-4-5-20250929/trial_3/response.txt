- Fork width (interior): 100mm
- Fork arm length: 150mm
- Fork arm angle: 35° from vertical
- Handle length: 150mm
- Handle diameter: 32mm

**Rationale:** 35° angle maximizes elastic band pre-tension while maintaining structural integrity. 100mm width accommodates full band extension without interference.

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

Material Properties:
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Thickness: 0.65mm
- Elastic modulus: 1.5-2.0 MPa (at 300% strain)
- Ultimate tensile strength: 25 MPa
- Maximum elongation: 700-800%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³
- Hysteresis loss: ~15%

### 2.2 Band Geometry
**Tapered Configuration:**
- Attachment end width: 25mm
- Pouch end width: 15mm
- Active length per side: 200mm
- Taper ratio: 1.67:1
- Total thickness: 0.65mm (single layer)

**Taper Justification:**
- Uniform stress distribution along band length
- Reduces mass at high-velocity end (pouch)
- Minimizes parasitic energy loss to band oscillation

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: 400mm (from rest position)
- Band extension ratio: λ = (200 + 400)/200 = 3.0
- Strain: ε = 200% (within safe operating range)

**Force-Extension Relationship:**
Using neo-Hookean model for rubber:
F = (E × A × ε) / L₀

Where:
- E = 1.75 MPa (average modulus at 200% strain)
- A = 25mm × 0.65mm = 16.25 mm² (average cross-section)
- ε = 2.0 (200% strain)
- L₀ = 200mm

F = (1.75 × 10⁶ Pa × 16.25 × 10⁻⁶ m²× 2.0) / 0.2m
**F = 284N per band (568N total)**

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
For rubber, energy stored:
U = ½ × F_avg × Δx

Assuming linear approximation (conservative):
- F_avg = 284N (actual force profile is non-linear, peak higher)
- Δx = 0.4m

U = ½ × 284N × 0.4m × 2 bands
**U = 113.6 Joules**

Accounting for 15% hysteresis loss:
**Effective energy = 96.6 Joules**
