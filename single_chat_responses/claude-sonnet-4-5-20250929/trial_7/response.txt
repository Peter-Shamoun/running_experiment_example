## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- Overall height: 300mm
- Fork width (inner): 80mm
- Fork arm length: 150mm
- Fork arm angle: 35° from vertical
- Handle length: 150mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm

**Rationale:** 35° angle maximizes elastic band elongation while maintaining structural integrity. 80mm spacing prevents pouch contact with frame during release.

### 1.2 Material Selection
**Primary Structure: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Yield Strength: 276 MPa
- Tensile Strength: 310 MPa
- Elastic Modulus: 68.9 GPa
- Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- Fatigue Strength: 96.5 MPa (500M cycles)

**Cross-section:** Hollow rectangular tube (25mm × 15mm, 3mm wall thickness)

**Stress Analysis:**
```
Maximum bending moment at fork junction:
M = F × L × sin(θ)
Where F = 200N (band tension), L = 150mm, θ = 35°

M = 200N × 0.15m × 0.574 = 17.2 N⋅m

Section modulus (rectangular hollow):
I/c = (bh³ - b₁h₁³)/(6h) = 1.89 × 10⁻⁶ m³

Bending stress: σ = M/(I/c) = 17.2/1.89×10⁻⁶ = 9.1 MPa

Safety Factor: 276/9.1 = 30.3 ✓
```

**Alternative for Maximum Rigidity:** Carbon fiber composite (unidirectional)
- Tensile Modulus: 135 GPa
- Tensile Strength: 1950 MPa
- Density: 1.55 g/cm³
- Cost consideration: 8× aluminum cost

## 2. ELASTIC SYSTEM DESIGN

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Theraband Gold (Latex Rubber)**

Properties:
- Tensile Strength: 20-25 MPa
- Elongation at Break: 700-850%
- Elastic Modulus: 1.5-2.0 MPa (at 100% strain)
- Hysteresis Loss: ~15%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Dimensions
**Tapered Configuration:**
- Attachment end: 25mm width × 1.5mm thickness
- Pouch end: 15mm width × 1.2mm thickness
- Active length per side: 200mm
- Taper angle: 2.86°

**Rationale:** Tapering ensures uniform stress distribution, preventing premature failure at high-stress attachment points.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw length:** 600mm (from rest position)

**Effective elongation per band:**
```
Initial length: L₀ = 200mm
Final length: L₁ = √(200² + 300²) = 360mm
Elongation: ΔL = 160mm
Strain: ε = 160/200 = 80% = 0.8
```

**Force-displacement relationship (Mooney-Rivlin model for rubber):**
```
F = A × E × ε × (1 + β × ε)

Where:
A = cross-sectional area = 25mm × 1.5mm = 37.5mm²
E = elastic modulus = 1.75 MPa
ε = 0.8
β = non-linearity coefficient = 0.3

F = 37.5×10⁻⁶ × 1.75×10⁶ × 0.8 × (1 + 0.3×0.8)
F = 52.5 × 1.24 = 65.1N per band

Total force (two bands): F_total = 130.2N
```

**Elastic potential energy stored:**
```
For non-linear elastic material:
U = ∫F dx = A × E × L₀ × [ε²/2 + β×ε³/3]

U = 37.5×10⁻⁶ × 1.75×10⁶ × 0.2 × [0.8²/2 + 0.3×0.8³/3]
U = 13.125 × [0.32 + 0.0512]
U = 4.87J per band

Total energy: U_total = 9.74J (both bands)
```

### 2.4 Attachment System
**Band-to-Frame Connection:**
- Method: Through-hole with aluminum sleeve
- Hole diameter: 8mm
- Sleeve length: 20mm
- Band wrapped 1.5 turns through sleeve

**Shear stress analysis:**
```
Bearing stress: σ_b = F/(d × t × n)
Where d = 8mm, t = 1.5mm, n = 3 contact surfaces

σ_b = 65.1/(0.008 × 0.0015 × 3) = 1.81 MPa

Material strength: 20 MPa
Safety factor: 11.0 ✓
```

- Surface: Polished (Ra < 0.4μm)

**Aerodynamic considerations:**

Re = 1.225 × 50 × 0.012 / 1.81×10⁻⁵ = 40,608

Drag coefficient (sphere): C_d ≈ 0.47

Drag force: F_d = 0.5 × ρ × v² × C_d × A
F_d = 0.5 × 1.225 × 50² × 0.47 × π×0.006²
F_d = 0.0326N
```

## 5. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Muzzle Velocity Calculation

**Energy transfer efficiency:** η = 0.85 (accounting for hysteresis, air resistance during draw, friction)

```
Kinetic energy imparted to projectile:
KE = η × U_total = 0.85 × 9.74J = 8.28J

Velocity: v = √(2×KE/m)
v = √(2 × 8.28 / 0.00665)
v = √2489 = 49.9 m/s ≈ 50 m/s (180 km/h)
```

### 5.2 Range Prediction

**Trajectory analysis (45° launch angle, optimal for range):**

```
Horizontal range (vacuum): R₀ = v²sin(2θ)/g
R₀ = 50² × sin(90°) / 9.81 = 255m

With air resistance (numerical integration):
Actual range: R ≈ 185m

Time of flight: t = 2v×sin(θ)/g = 7.2s
Maximum height: h = v²×sin²(θ)/(2g) = 63.7m
```

**Drag deceleration:**
```
a_drag = -F_d/m = -0.0326/0.00665 = -4.9 m/s²
(at initial velocity; decreases as v² decreases)
```
