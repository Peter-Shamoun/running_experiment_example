## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions

**Y-Frame Configuration:**
- **Handle length:** 200mm
- **Fork height:** 150mm from handle top
- **Fork width (interior):** 80mm
- **Fork arm thickness:** 25mm × 40mm (rectangular cross-section)
- **Fork angle:** 30° from vertical (optimizes band alignment)

**Rationale:** The Y-frame provides maximum structural rigidity while minimizing weight. The 30° fork angle aligns with the natural draw angle, reducing lateral forces that cause accuracy degradation.

### 1.2 Material Specification

**Primary Material:** 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Yield strength: 276 MPa
- Tensile strength: 310 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 68.9 GPa
- Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- Fatigue strength: 96.5 MPa (at 5×10⁸ cycles)

**Stress Analysis:**
Maximum bending moment at fork junction:
```
M = F × L = 200N × 0.075m = 15 N⋅m
Section modulus: S = (b×h²)/6 = (0.025×0.040²)/6 = 6.67×10⁻⁶ m³
Bending stress: σ = M/S = 15/(6.67×10⁻⁶) = 2.25 MPa
Safety factor: 276/2.25 = 122.7
```

**Alternative:** Hardwood (Maple) for traditional approach
- Modulus of rupture: 108 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 12.6 GPa
- Density: 0.71 g/cm³

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Optimal Material:** Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber tubing)

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Elastic modulus: 1.5-2.0 MPa (highly strain-dependent)
- Ultimate tensile strength: 25-30 MPa
- Maximum elongation: 700-800%
- Hysteresis loss: ~15-20%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Dimensions

**Configuration:** Tapered flat bands (superior to tubes)

**Dimensions:**
- **Active length (per side):** 200mm
- **Width at attachment:** 25mm → **Width at pouch:** 15mm (taper)
- **Thickness:** 0.75mm
- **Total band mass:** ~11g (both sides)

**Taper Rationale:** Ensures uniform stress distribution along band length, preventing premature failure at high-stress points.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: 600mm (from rest position)
- Elongation ratio: λ = (200 + 600)/200 = 4.0 (400% strain)

**Force-Extension Relationship (Mooney-Rivlin model for rubber):**

For simplified analysis, using empirical data:
```
At 400% elongation: F ≈ 180-200N (total, both bands)
```

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
```
Using work integral: U = ∫F(x)dx

Approximating with average force method:
F_avg ≈ 100N (over draw length)
U = F_avg × d = 100N × 0.6m = 60 Joules
```

**Accounting for hysteresis (20% loss):**
```
U_effective = 60J × 0.80 = 48 Joules
```

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications

**Material:** Soft leather (vegetable-tanned, 2mm thickness)

**Dimensions:**
- Length: 60mm
- Width: 40mm
- Projectile cup depth: 8mm

**Attachment:** Reinforced stitching with 4mm overlap on each band

**Mass:** ~3g

### 3.2 Design Rationale

The cupped design centers the projectile and ensures consistent release angle. Soft leather provides grip without excessive friction that would reduce efficiency.

## 4. PROJECTILE SPECIFICATIONS

### 4.1 Optimal Projectile Design

**Material:** Lead spheres (for maximum kinetic energy)

**Dimensions:**
- Diameter: 12mm
- Mass: 8.5g
- Density: 11.34 g/cm³

**Alternative (safety consideration):** Steel ball bearings
- Diameter: 12mm
- Mass: 7.0g
- Density: 7.85 g/cm³

### 4.2 Ballistic Performance Calculations

**Muzzle Velocity (Lead projectile):**

Using energy conservation:
```
U_effective = ½mv² + losses

Assuming 85% energy transfer efficiency:
KE_projectile = 48J × 0.85 = 40.8J

v = √(2×KE/m) = √(2×40.8/0.0085) = 97.9 m/s
```

**Muzzle Energy:**
```
KE = 40.8 Joules
```

**Comparative Analysis:**
| Projectile | Mass (g) | Velocity (m/s) | KE (J) | Momentum (kg⋅m/s) |
|------------|----------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| Lead 12mm | 8.5 | 97.9 | 40.8 | 0.832 |
| Steel 12mm | 7.0 | 108.1 | 40.9 | 0.757 |
| Clay 12mm | 5.0 | 127.8 | 40.9 | 0.639 |

## 5. ACCURACY OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 Release Mechanism Analysis

**Critical Factors:**

1. **Pouch Release Timing:**
   - Optimal release: when bands reach parallel to projectile trajectory
   - Release angle deviation tolerance: ±0.5° for 1% accuracy loss

2. **Band Symmetry:**
   - Force imbalance tolerance: <2% between bands
   - Length matching: ±1mm

### 5.2 Stability Features

**Fork Width Optimization:**
```
Optimal width = 80mm provides:
- Clearance ratio: 80mm/12mm = 6.67:1
- Minimizes band interference
- Reduces lateral oscillation
```

**Anchor Point Design:**
- Recessed grooves (3mm deep) in fork tips
- Prevents band migration during draw
- Ensures repeatable geometry

## 6. RANGE PREDICTIONS

### 6.1 Trajectory Analysis

**Launch Parameters:**
- Muzzle velocity: 98 m/s
- Optimal launch angle: 35-40° (accounting for drag)
- Launch height: 1.5m

**Drag Force Modeling:**

```
F_drag = ½ρv²C_D A

Where:
ρ = 1.225 kg/m³ (air density)
C_D = 0.47 (sphere)
A = π(0.006)² = 1.13×10⁻⁴ m²
```

**Range Calculation (simplified ballistic trajectory):**

Without drag (theoretical maximum):
```
R = (v²sin(2θ))/g = (98²×sin(70°))/9.81 = 920m
```

With drag (numerical integration required for precision):
```
Estimated range: 180-220m (at 35° elevation)
```

**Accuracy Prediction:**
- Grouping at 30m: 50mm radius (with consistent technique)
- Primary error sources: release timing (60%), band asymmetry (25%), wind (15%)
