## 1. FRAME DESIGN & STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Frame Geometry

**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- **Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy
  - Yield Strength: 503 MPa
  - Elastic Modulus: 71.7 GPa
  - Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- **Dimensions:**
  - Handle length: 150 mm
  - Fork arm length: 120 mm
  - Fork angle: 35° from centerline (70° total spread)
  - Fork arm diameter: 25 mm
  - Wall thickness: 4 mm (hollow construction)

**Rationale:** The 70° fork spread optimizes the force vector geometry. At full draw, elastic bands form approximately 15° angle from horizontal, maximizing forward force component (cos 15° = 0.966, or 96.6% efficiency).

### 1.2 Structural Analysis

**Maximum Band Tension:** 200 N per band (400 N total)

**Bending Moment at Fork Base:**
- M = F × L × sin(θ)
- M = 200 N × 0.12 m × sin(35°) = 13.76 N·m

**Bending Stress:**
- For hollow cylinder: σ = (M × r_outer) / I
- I = π(r_o⁴ - r_i⁴)/4 = π(12.5⁴ - 8.5⁴)/4 = 18,563 mm⁴
- σ = (13,760 N·mm × 12.5 mm) / 18,563 mm⁴ = 9.26 MPa

**Safety Factor:** 503 MPa / 9.26 MPa = **54.3** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Material:** Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)
- **Mechanical Properties:**
  - Tensile Strength: 20 MPa
  - Elongation at Break: 700-800%
  - Elastic Modulus: 1.5 MPa (at 100% strain)
  - Hysteresis Loss: ~15%

### 2.2 Band Dimensions

**Configuration:** Tapered design
- **Attachment end:** 25 mm width × 0.75 mm thickness
- **Pouch end:** 15 mm width × 0.75 mm thickness
- **Active length:** 200 mm per side
- **Taper:** Linear reduction over 150 mm

**Rationale:** Tapering reduces mass at the pouch end, minimizing kinetic energy wasted accelerating the bands themselves. Mass reduction of ~30% at terminal end significantly improves efficiency.

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw length:** 600 mm (from rest position)

**Effective Elongation:**
- Initial band length: 200 mm
- At full draw: √(300² + 100²) = 316 mm per side
- Elongation: (316-200)/200 = **58% strain**

**Force-Extension Relationship:**
For latex at moderate strain (Mooney-Rivlin model approximation):
- F = A × E × ε × (1 + k×ε)
- Cross-sectional area: A = 25 mm × 0.75 mm = 18.75 mm²
- F = 18.75 mm² × 1.5 MPa × 0.58 × (1 + 0.3×0.58)
- F ≈ 19.4 N per band at pouch end

**Average force during draw:** ~100 N per band

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
- E = 2 × ∫F dx ≈ 2 × (F_avg × extension)
- E = 2 × 100 N × 0.116 m = **23.2 Joules**

**Accounting for hysteresis (15% loss):**
- Effective energy: 23.2 J × 0.85 = **19.7 Joules**

- **Dimensions:** 50 mm × 40 mm
- **Thickness:** 1.5 mm
- **Mass:** 3 grams
- **Attachment:** Reinforced holes with 2 mm diameter

**Projectile Cradle:** Shallow depression (2 mm depth) for projectile retention

### 3.2 Energy Loss Analysis

**Kinetic energy in pouch at release:**
- Pouch velocity ≈ projectile velocity = v
- E_pouch = ½ × 0.003 kg × v²
- For v = 50 m/s: E_pouch = 3.75 J (represents loss)

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN & BALLISTICS

### 4.1 Projectile Specifications

**Material:** Lead-free solder spheres (96.5% Tin, 3% Silver, 0.5% Copper)

- **Diameter:** 12 mm
- **Mass:** 6.6 grams
- **Surface:** Polished (drag coefficient optimization)

**Alternative for safety:** Steel ball bearings (AISI 52100)
- **Density:** 7.85 g/cm³

### 4.2 Velocity Calculations

**Energy available for projectile:**
- Total stored: 19.7 J
- Pouch loss: ~3.75 J
- Band recoil: ~2 J
- Available: **14 J**

**Projectile velocity (6.6g projectile):**
- ½mv² = 14 J
- v = √(2×14/0.0066) = **65.2 m/s**

**Efficiency:** 14/19.7 = **71%** (excellent for elastic systems)

### 4.3 Ballistic Performance

**Range Calculation (45° launch angle, 1.5m release height):**

Time of flight:
- t = [v×sin(45°) + √((v×sin(45°))² + 2gh)] / g
- t = [46.1 + √(2125 + 29.4)] / 9.81 = 9.45 seconds

Horizontal range:
- R = v×cos(45°)×t = 46.1 × 9.45 = **435.6 meters** (theoretical, no drag)

**With drag correction (C_d = 0.47 for sphere):**
- Drag force: F_d = ½ρv²C_d A
- Terminal velocity consideration and numerical integration yields:
- **Practical range: ~85-95 meters**

### 4.4 Accuracy Factors

**Spin Stabilization:**
- Spherical projectiles are inherently stable
- No Magnus effect with symmetric release
- Minimal yaw/pitch oscillation

**Release Consistency:**
- Pouch design ensures central loading
- Symmetric band tension critical: ±2% tolerance
- Release timing: bands must separate simultaneously (<5ms difference)
