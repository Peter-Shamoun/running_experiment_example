## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions

**Y-Frame Configuration:**
- **Overall height:** 400 mm
- **Fork width (interior):** 100 mm
- **Fork arm length:** 180 mm
- **Handle length:** 220 mm
- **Fork arm angle:** 35° from vertical (optimizes band attachment geometry)
- **Handle diameter:** 32 mm (ergonomic grip)

**Rationale:** The 35° fork angle maximizes the effective draw length while maintaining structural integrity. The 100mm fork width prevents band-to-fork contact during release while accommodating wrist rotation.

### 1.2 Material Specification

**Primary Material:** 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Tensile strength: 572 MPa
- Yield strength: 503 MPa
- Elastic modulus: 71.7 GPa
- Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- Fatigue strength: 159 MPa (at 5×10⁸ cycles)

**Cross-sectional Design:**
- Fork arms: 25mm × 15mm rectangular profile
- Wall thickness: 4mm (hollow construction)
- Handle: 32mm outer diameter, 3mm wall thickness

**Stress Analysis:**

Maximum bending moment at fork junction:
```
M = F × L × sin(θ)
Where F = band tension = 200N (per side)
L = moment arm = 180mm
θ = 35°

M = 200N × 0.18m × sin(35°) = 20.6 N⋅m
```

Bending stress:
```
σ = M⋅c / I

For rectangular hollow section:
I = (25×15³ - 17×7³)/12 = 6,797 mm⁴
c = 7.5mm

σ = (20.6×10³ N⋅mm × 7.5mm) / 6,797 mm⁴ = 22.7 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:** 503 MPa / 22.7 MPa = **22.2** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC SYSTEM DESIGN

### 2.1 Band Material Selection

**Material:** Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Tensile strength: 20 MPa
- Elongation at break: 850%
- Elastic modulus (at 300% strain): 1.8 MPa
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³
- Hysteresis loss: ~15%

### 2.2 Band Geometry

**Tapered Design:**
- **Attachment end (fork):** 40mm width × 1.5mm thickness
- **Pouch end:** 20mm width × 1.5mm thickness
- **Active length (each side):** 200mm
- **Taper profile:** Linear reduction

**Rationale:** Tapering reduces mass in the high-velocity region while maintaining strength at attachment points, minimizing energy loss to band oscillation.

**Total band mass:** 
```
Average width = 30mm
Volume = 2 × (30mm × 1.5mm × 200mm) = 18,000 mm³
Mass = 18,000 mm³ × 0.92 g/cm³ = 16.6 g
```

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculation

**Draw length:** 600mm (from pouch rest to full draw)

**Effective elongation per band:**
```
Initial length: 200mm
Final length: √(200² + 300²) = 360mm
Elongation: 160mm
Strain: 160/200 = 80% = 0.8
```

**Force-elongation relationship** (rubber follows non-linear behavior):
```
F = A × E × ε × (1 + k×ε²)

Where:
A = cross-sectional area = 40mm × 1.5mm = 60 mm²
E = elastic modulus = 1.8 MPa
ε = strain = 0.8
k = non-linearity coefficient ≈ 0.5

F = 60 mm² × 1.8 MPa × 0.8 × (1 + 0.5×0.64)
F = 60 × 1.8 × 0.8 × 1.32 = 114 N per band
Total force = 228 N
```

**Stored elastic energy:**
```
U = 2 × ∫F dx from 0 to 160mm

For non-linear elastic:
U ≈ 2 × [½ × 228N × 0.16m × 0.85] (0.85 accounts for non-linearity)
U = 31.0 Joules
```

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications

**Material:** Vegetable-tanned leather (3-4 oz weight)
- **Dimensions:** 60mm × 40mm
- **Thickness:** 2.0mm
- **Projectile cradle:** 25mm diameter circular depression
- **Mass:** 3.2g

**Attachment:** Reinforced with nylon thread, creating 15mm attachment tabs on each side

**Rationale:** Leather provides optimal friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0.6) for projectile retention during draw while releasing cleanly. The circular depression centers the projectile and prevents rolling.

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

- **Diameter:** 12mm
- **Mass:** 7.1g

**Rationale:** High density maximizes kinetic energy for given velocity. Spherical geometry ensures aerodynamic stability and consistent contact mechanics.

### 4.2 Alternative: Optimized Lead Projectile

**Material:** Pure lead (for maximum density)
- Density: 11.34 g/cm³
- **Diameter:** 10mm
- **Mass:** 5.9g

## 5. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Energy Transfer Efficiency

**Energy budget:**

1. **Stored elastic energy:** 31.0 J
2. **Losses:**
   - Hysteresis in rubber: 31.0 × 0.15 = 4.7 J
   - Band kinetic energy: ½ × 0.0166kg × v²band
   - Pouch kinetic energy: ½ × 0.0032kg × v²pouch
   - Air resistance during draw: ~0.3 J

**Band velocity estimation:**
The band center of mass travels approximately 40% of projectile distance:
```
vband ≈ 0.4 × vprojectile
```

**Energy equation:**
```
Eelastic = Eprojectile + Eband + Epouch + Elosses

31.0 = ½(0.0071)v² + ½(0.0166)(0.4v)² + ½(0.0032)(v)² + 5.0

31.0 = 0.00355v² + 0.001328v² + 0.0016v² + 5.0
26.0 = 0.006578v²
v² = 3,952
v = 62.9 m/s
```

**Projectile kinetic energy:** ½ × 0.0071kg × (62.9)² = **14.0 J**

**Transfer efficiency:** 14.0 / 31.0 = **45.2%**

### 5.2 Range Calculation

**Launch angle:** 35° (optimal for maximum range with air resistance)

**Ballistic coefficient:**
```
BC = m / (Cd × A)

Where:
m = 0.0071 kg
Cd = 0.47 (sphere)
A = π(0.006)² = 1.131×10⁻⁴ m²

BC = 0.0071 / (0.47 × 1.131×10⁻⁴) = 133.6 kg/m²
```

**Range with air resistance** (numerical integration required, approximation):

Without air resistance:
```
R = v² sin(2θ) / g = (62.9)² × sin(70°) / 9.81 = 378 m
```

With air resistance (using drag equation):
```
Estimated range ≈ 85-90m (depending on altitude/conditions)
```

1. **Release timing variation:** ±2ms

3. **Projectile mass variation:** ±0.1g
   - Velocity change: ±0.9 m/s
   - Range variation: ±1.2m
