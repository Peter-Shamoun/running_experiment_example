---

## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- Overall height: 300mm
- Fork width (outer): 120mm
- Fork arm angle: 25° from vertical
- Handle length: 180mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm (ergonomic grip)

**Rationale:** The 25° angle optimizes the force vector geometry during full draw, minimizing lateral stress while maximizing forward energy transfer. This angle reduces the cosine loss factor to ~0.906, retaining >90% of elastic force in the projectile direction.

### 1.2 Material Selection
**Primary Structure: 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile Strength: 572 MPa
- Yield Strength: 503 MPa
- Elastic Modulus: 71.7 GPa
- Density: 2.81 g/cm³
- Fatigue Strength: 159 MPa (5×10⁸ cycles)

**Cross-section:** Hollow rectangular tube (40mm × 25mm, 3mm wall thickness)

**Justification:** 
- High strength-to-weight ratio (203,000 N·m/kg)
- Excellent fatigue resistance for repeated loading
- Sufficient rigidity (I = 1.67×10⁴ mm⁴) to prevent frame flexing that would waste energy
- Mass: ~280g (lightweight for stability during aim)

**Stress Analysis:**
At peak draw force (200N per band):
- Bending moment at fork junction: M = 200N × 0.15m = 30 N·m
- Maximum bending stress: σ = My/I = 30 × 0.02/1.67×10⁻⁸ = 35.9 MPa
- Safety factor: 503/35.9 = **14.0** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material
**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

Specifications:
- Material: Natural latex rubber
- Dimensions per band: 200mm length × 25mm width × 0.65mm thickness
- Configuration: Dual bands (bilateral symmetry)

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile strength: 25 MPa
- Elongation at break: 850%
- Elastic modulus (initial): 1.5 MPa
- Hysteresis loss: ~15% per cycle

### 2.2 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Parameters:**
- Draw length: 600mm (from rest to full draw)
- Active band length: 200mm
- Strain: ε = 600/200 = 3.0 (300% elongation)

**Force-Extension Relationship:**
For latex rubber, use Mooney-Rivlin model (simplified):
F = A × E × (λ - 1/λ²)

Where:
- A = cross-sectional area = 25mm × 0.65mm = 16.25 mm²
- E = elastic modulus = 1.5 MPa
- λ = extension ratio = 4.0

F = 16.25 × 1.5 × (4 - 1/16) = 97.5N per band

**Total force at full draw: 195N (dual bands)**

**Stored Elastic Energy:**
For hyperelastic materials:
U = ∫F·dx ≈ (1/2) × F_avg × Δx

Average force during draw: ~97.5N (accounting for non-linear stiffening)
U = 97.5N × 0.6m = **58.5 J per band**
**Total stored energy: 117 J**

### 2.3 Taper Design
**Linear taper from 25mm (pouch end) to 15mm (fork attachment)**

Rationale: Tapered bands reduce distal mass, increasing the efficiency of energy transfer. The lighter pouch-end accelerates faster, reducing the "follow-through" mass that continues moving after projectile release.

**Efficiency gain: ~8-12%** compared to uniform bands

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Material & Dimensions
**Material:** Vegetable-tanned leather (3-4 oz weight)
- Thickness: 1.2mm
- Dimensions: 60mm × 40mm (oval)
- Center depression: 8mm radius hemisphere

**Attachment:** Reinforced holes with brass grommets, connected via 20mm latex tabs

### 3.2 Performance Characteristics
- Mass: 2.5g (minimizes parasitic energy loss)
- Projectile retention: Hemispherical depression centers projectile, prevents premature release
- Release consistency: Smooth leather surface ensures uniform friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0.3)

---

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Specifications
**Material:** Lead-free solder spheres (96.5% Sn, 3% Ag, 0.5% Cu)

Properties:
- Density: 7.37 g/cm³
- Diameter: 12mm
- Mass: 6.7g
- Surface: Polished (drag coefficient optimization)

### 4.2 Ballistic Calculations

**Muzzle Velocity:**
Assuming 75% energy transfer efficiency (accounting for band recoil, air resistance during draw, pouch mass):

KE_projectile = 0.75 × 117J = 87.75J

v = √(2×KE/m) = √(2×87.75/0.0067) = **162 m/s**

**Drag Analysis:**
- Reynolds number at launch: Re = ρvD/μ = 1.225×162×0.012/1.81×10⁻⁵ = 131,000
- Flow regime: Subcritical (turbulent boundary layer)
- Drag coefficient: C_d ≈ 0.47 (sphere)
- Drag force at launch: F_d = 0.5×ρ×v²×C_d×A = 0.5×1.225×162²×0.47×π×0.006² = 0.87N

**Range Calculation (45° launch angle, sea level):**

Using ballistic trajectory equations with drag:

Range ≈ (v²/g) × sin(2θ) × [1 - (C_d×ρ×A×v²)/(2mg)] 

Simplified for this projectile:
**Maximum range: ~185 meters** (with optimal 42° angle accounting for drag)
