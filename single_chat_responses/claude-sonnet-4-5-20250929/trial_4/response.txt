## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Fork Configuration:**
- Overall height: 300mm
- Fork width (inner): 80mm
- Fork width (outer): 120mm
- Handle length: 150mm
- Handle diameter: 35mm
- Fork arm thickness: 20mm
- Fork arm width: 30mm

**Rationale:** 80mm inner width provides optimal band attachment spacing for 60-70° launch angle convergence, minimizing lateral energy loss while maintaining structural clearance.

### 1.2 Material Selection
**Primary Material: 6061-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile Strength: 310 MPa
- Yield Strength: 276 MPa
- Elastic Modulus: 68.9 GPa
- Density: 2.70 g/cm³
- Fatigue Strength: 96.5 MPa (500M cycles)

**Justification:**
- High strength-to-weight ratio (114 kN·m/kg)
- Excellent fatigue resistance for repeated loading
- Machinability allows precise tolerancing
- Weight: ~180g (minimizes moment of inertia during aiming)

**Alternative for Handle: Glass-Filled Nylon (PA66-GF30)**
- Tensile Strength: 185 MPa
- Vibration damping coefficient: 0.08
- Ergonomic moldability
- Weight reduction: 40g vs. aluminum

### 1.3 Structural Analysis

**Maximum Bending Moment (at fork junction):**
```
Assuming 200N band tension at full draw:
M = F × d = 200N × 0.04m = 8 N·m

Section Modulus (rectangular): S = bh²/6
S = (0.03m)(0.02m)²/6 = 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ m³

Bending Stress: σ = M/S = 8/(2.0×10⁻⁶) = 4 MPa
```

**Safety Factor:** 276 MPa / 4 MPa = **69** (excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC SYSTEM DESIGN

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Theraband Gold (or equivalent latex rubber)**

Mechanical Properties:
- Tensile Strength: 20 MPa
- Elongation at Break: 850%
- Elastic Modulus (at 300% strain): 1.8 MPa
- Hysteresis Loss: 15-18%
- Density: 0.92 g/cm³

### 2.2 Band Dimensions
**Tapered Configuration:**
- Attachment end: 25mm width × 0.7mm thickness
- Pouch end: 15mm width × 0.7mm thickness
- Active length per side: 200mm
- Taper angle: 2.86°

**Rationale for Tapering:**
- Uniform stress distribution along band length
- Reduces mass at high-velocity end (pouch)
- Stress concentration factor reduced from 1.8 to 1.2

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculations

**Draw Length:** 600mm (from pouch rest to full draw)

**Force-Extension Relationship (Mooney-Rivlin model for rubber):**
```
For 300% elongation (200mm → 800mm total band path):
Strain ratio λ = 4.0

Force per band ≈ 100N at full draw
Total force (both bands) = 200N
```

**Elastic Potential Energy:**
```
For non-linear elastic material:
U = ∫F dx

Approximating with average force method:
U = (1/2) × F_avg × Δx
U = (1/2) × 100N × 0.6m = 30 J per band
Total: 60 J stored
```

**Accounting for losses:**
- Hysteresis loss: 18% → 49.2 J
- Air resistance during band retraction: 3% → 47.7 J
- Friction at pouch: 2% → 46.7 J

**Available kinetic energy: ~47 J**

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications
- Material: Vegetable-tanned leather (2mm thickness)
- Dimensions: 50mm × 40mm

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Optimal Projectile Specifications

**Material: Lead-Free Solder Sphere (Sn96.5/Ag3.0/Cu0.5)**
- Density: 7.37 g/cm³
- Diameter: 12mm
- Mass: 6.4g

**Ballistic Coefficient Calculation:**
```
Sectional Density: SD = m/(d²) = 0.0064kg/(0.012m)² = 44.4 kg/m²

Drag Coefficient (sphere): C_d ≈ 0.47

BC = SD/C_d = 44.4/0.47 = 94.5 kg/m²
```

### 4.2 Projectile Mass Optimization

**Kinetic Energy Transfer:**
```
KE = (1/2)mv²

For 47J available:
v = √(2×47J/0.0064kg) = 121 m/s theoretical

Accounting for 15% transfer inefficiency:
v_actual ≈ 103 m/s
```

**Why 6.4g is optimal:**
- Lighter projectiles: Higher velocity but excessive air resistance losses
- Heavier projectiles: Insufficient acceleration, reduced range
- 6.4g balances momentum retention with achievable velocity

## 5. PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS

### 5.1 Range Calculation

**Launch angle:** 35° (optimal for this velocity regime)

**Range equation with drag:**
```
Simplified model using ballistic coefficient:

R ≈ (v₀²/g) × sin(2θ) × [1 - (ρ_air × C_d × A × R)/(2m)]

Initial calculation (no drag):
R₀ = (103²/9.81) × sin(70°) = 1,016m

Drag correction factor for BC=94.5:
η ≈ 0.72 for first 100m

Effective range: 73m
```
