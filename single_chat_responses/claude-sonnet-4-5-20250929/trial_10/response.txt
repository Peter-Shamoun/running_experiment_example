## 1. FRAME DESIGN

### 1.1 Geometry & Dimensions
**Y-Frame Configuration (Optimal)**

```
Handle Length: 150mm
Fork Height: 200mm
Fork Width (inner): 80mm
Fork Angle: 15° outward from vertical
Fork Arm Thickness: 25mm × 40mm (rectangular cross-section)
```

**Rationale:**
- 15° fork angle prevents band-to-frame contact during full draw
- 80mm inner width accommodates 60mm band separation + safety margin
- Rectangular cross-section maximizes bending resistance (I = bh³/12)

### 1.2 Material Specification
**Primary Choice: 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy**

| Property | Value | Justification |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Tensile Strength | 572 MPa | Withstands peak loads >500N |
| Yield Strength | 503 MPa | No plastic deformation |
| Elastic Modulus | 71.7 GPa | Minimal frame flex (energy loss) |
| Density | 2.81 g/cm³ | Lightweight for stability |
| Fatigue Strength | 159 MPa | Sustained competition use |

**Alternative: G10 Fiberglass Composite**
- Tensile Strength: 310 MPa
- Better vibration damping (reduced hand shock)
- Lower cost, slightly heavier

### 1.3 Stress Analysis
Maximum bending moment at fork base during 200N draw force:

```
M = F × L × sin(θ)
M = 200N × 0.2m × sin(15°) = 10.34 N⋅m

Bending stress: σ = Mc/I
I = (25mm × 40³mm)/12 = 133,333 mm⁴
c = 20mm
σ = (10.34 × 0.02) / (133,333 × 10⁻¹²) = 1.55 MPa
```

**Safety Factor: 503/1.55 = 324** (Excellent)

## 2. ELASTIC PROPULSION SYSTEM

### 2.1 Band Material Selection
**Theraband Gold (Latex Rubber)**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Tensile Strength | 20 MPa |
| Elongation at Break | 850% |
| Elastic Modulus (initial) | 1.5 MPa |
| Hysteresis Loss | ~15% |
| Density | 0.92 g/cm³ |

### 2.2 Band Dimensions (Per Side)
```
Active Length (L₀): 200mm
Width: 30mm (tapered to 20mm at pouch)
Thickness: 0.75mm
Taper Ratio: 1.5:1 (reduces tip flutter)
Draw Length: 600mm (300% extension)
```

### 2.3 Energy Storage Calculation

**Force-Extension Relationship (Non-linear):**
For latex at high strain: F ≈ k₁Δx + k₂Δx²

Simplified model using average force:
```
Extension ratio: λ = 800mm/200mm = 4.0
Strain: ε = 300%

Average force per band (empirical): F_avg = 85N
Total force (2 bands): F_total = 170N

Elastic PE stored:
E = ½ × F_avg × Δx × 2 bands
E = ½ × 85N × 0.6m × 2 = 51 Joules
```

### 2.4 Energy Transfer Efficiency

**Loss Mechanisms:**
- Hysteresis (internal friction): 15% → 7.65J lost
- Air resistance during band retraction: 3% → 1.53J lost
- Vibration/sound: 2% → 1.02J lost

**Net energy to projectile: 51J × 0.80 = 40.8J**

## 3. POUCH DESIGN

### 3.1 Specifications
```
Material: Vegetable-tanned leather (2mm thick)
Dimensions: 40mm × 60mm
Projectile Cup Depth: 8mm
Edge Reinforcement: Doubled leather at attachment points
```

**Attachment Method:**
- Through-holes with tapered band insertion
- Contact area: 20mm × 30mm per side
- Shear stress: τ = F/(2 × A) = 170N/(2 × 600mm²) = 0.14 MPa
- Leather shear strength: ~8 MPa (SF = 57)

### 3.2 Release Dynamics
Pouch separation velocity must be < projectile velocity to ensure clean release:
- Finger separation time: ~0.015s
- Pouch deceleration: a = -v²/2s ≈ -2000 m/s²
- Requires smooth finger positioning (no grip texture)

## 4. PROJECTILE DESIGN

### 4.1 Optimal Projectile Specifications

**Material: Lead-Free Solder Sphere (96.5% Tin, 3.5% Silver)**

```
Diameter: 12mm
Mass: 8.5 grams
Density: 7.37 g/cm³
Surface: Polished (Cd ≈ 0.47)
```

**Rationale:**
- High density maximizes momentum retention
- Spherical geometry ensures stability
- Consistent manufacturing (cast in molds)

### 4.2 Ballistic Performance Calculations

**Initial Velocity:**
```
KE = ½mv²
40.8J = ½ × 0.0085kg × v²
v = √(40.8 × 2 / 0.0085) = 98 m/s
```

**Range Calculation (45° launch angle):**
```
Drag force: F_d = ½ρv²C_d A
A = π(0.006m)² = 1.13 × 10⁻⁴ m²

Using numerical integration for trajectory with drag:
Maximum range ≈ 185 meters (theoretical)
Practical range (30° angle): ~120 meters
```

**Accuracy Factors:**
- Spherical symmetry eliminates Magnus effect
- High sectional density (SD = m/A = 75 g/cm²) reduces wind drift
- Spin stabilization not required

### 4.3 Alternative Projectile Options

| Material | Mass (12mm) | Velocity | Range | Cost |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|------|
| Steel | 7.1g | 105 m/s | 195m | Low |
| Lead-free solder | 8.5g | 98 m/s | 185m | Medium |
| Clay (hardened) | 3.2g | 158 m/s | 165m | Very Low |

**Recommendation:** Lead-free solder for optimal balance

```

### 5.2 Aiming Methodology
**Anchor Point Consistency:**

- Head position: cheek weld on hand

**Elevation Compensation:**
```
For 30m target at 30° angle:
Drop compensation ≈ 0.8m

```

### 6.1 Handle Design
```
Length: 150mm
