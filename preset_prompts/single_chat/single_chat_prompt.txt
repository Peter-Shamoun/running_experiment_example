I am participating in a rigorous slingshot design competition organized by my university's engineering society, with the objective of constructing the most effective slingshot in terms of power and precision. The panel of judges, comprising expert physicists, will rigorously evaluate my design, probing the rationale for each decision: how the configuration optimizes energy transfer, the features that enhance performance in range and accuracy assessments, and the quantitative analyses that demonstrate its superiority over competing entries. Please guide me through a comprehensive design proposal for my submission. Outline the components ensuring exceptional performance through precise dimensions, material specifications with mechanical properties, and estimates for force output for every design choice. Focus exclusively on the design blueprint and quantitative engineering analysis of the slingshot and the projectiles.
