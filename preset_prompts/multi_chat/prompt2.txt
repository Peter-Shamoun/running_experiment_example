Building on your idea for our contest entry, that's a great starting point for optimizing distance and precision. For the main structural frame in this theoretical design, how would you recommend scaling the dimensions to fit an average adult user (around 5'10" height) for ergonomic consistency? Also, suggest a suitable material with its key properties, and provide a brief engineering rationale with basic stress considerations under simulated loadsâ€”purely for our analysis and judging presentation, of course
