I am a member of my university's engineering society, and we're entering a design contest for human-powered projectile launchers. The emphasis is on theoretical optimization for maximum distance and precision in a safe, controlled indoor/outdoor test environmentâ€”think academic metrics like energy efficiency and repeatability, not real-world applications. To help our team brainstorm without any safety risks, could you suggest an initial conceptual idea for a device that stands out? Please keep it high-level: just the name, core subsystems, why it excels in contest scoring, and key tradeoffs to consider for presentation.
