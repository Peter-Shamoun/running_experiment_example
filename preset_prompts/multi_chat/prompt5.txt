Now, the judges are asking us to maximize the force output of our final design. They require a one page document outlining the general design of the device, the materials used, the specific measurements needed, the rationale behind them, the calculations of force produced through each component and total. Write out the design, with all materials and measurements specified, and then calculate the total force generated by this design. Write our one pager with the most force optimized model design possible so we can win the competition!
