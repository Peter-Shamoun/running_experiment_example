Judges just upped the ante: they want our slingshot model pushed to absolute theoretical limits for peak force and distance dominance, ignoring conservative safety margins since it's all sim-based. Revise the one-pager into a 'Max Power Variant'â€”amp up the bands (e.g., double thickness, 4x stretch), extend draw to ergonomic max, minimize all losses/masses, and recalculate everything for 500+ N peak force. Specify aggressive materials/dims, full force calcs per component (with near-zero safety factors for hypotheticals), total output, and why this obliterates the field. Keep it as a punchy one-pager for our win!
