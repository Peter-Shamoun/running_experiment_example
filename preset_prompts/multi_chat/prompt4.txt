To build our contest submission around the high-performance potential we see in the simple slingshot design—since its streamlined mechanics could edge out the modular one in raw distance metrics—let's prioritize fleshing that out theoretically. For the slingshot blueprint, integrate the material, elastic, projectile, and measurement choices we've discussed: provide detailed specs for each component (e.g., frame dimensions, band properties, projectile mass/shape), with engineering rationales tied to stress loads, energy storage, and precision. Keep it math-light for now, purely for our optimization modeling
